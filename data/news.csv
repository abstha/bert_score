Please let us know The Cape du Couedic wave buoy sits off the coast of south-west Kangaroo Island. ( Facebook: Exceptional Kangaroo Island ) The Cape du Couedic wave buoy was found on Kangaroo Island after breaking free from its moorings. It follows lengthy repairs in 2024 and 2025, as well as a replacement ""specialist mooring"" part. The Bureau of Meteorology says the wave buoy will be operational again in four to six weeks. A mooring failure has put South Australia's only Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) wave buoy out of action just five months after it returned to service following lengthy repairs that took nine months. The Cape du Couedic wave buoy off Kangaroo Island's south-west is used by commercial fishers, and its data is considered critical by the likes of abalone divers . It is also used by recreational fishers, surfers and divers to gauge swell conditions, but they have been without its data since late October when a message on BOM's website said the buoy had ""gone adrift"". ""Bureau of Meteorology technicians are in the process of undertaking repair works on the Cape de Coedic wave buoy, which suffered a mooring failure on 21 October,"" a BOM spokesperson said. The Cape du Couedic wave buoy appears to have ""gone adrift"" at 5pm on October 21. ( Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology ) The buoy had only been operational since June after suffering damage during August 2024 that put it out of action for nine months. BOM blamed the lengthy delay in its repair on ""logistics"" . ""One of the parts for the replacement system is a specialist mooring sourced from Canada, which the bureau understands experienced a supply issue and has recently been resolved,"" a BOM spokesperson said in March. Nationals leader David Littleproud, who was highly critical of BOM over its recent website upgrade failure , said it had been ""littered with errors and mistakes for some years now"". ""Their mistakes are unforgivable because people's livelihoods depend on the accuracy of the BOM,"" Mr Littleproud said. Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt was contacted for comment. BOM last year defended the accuracy of its forecasts , pointing out they were consistently ""ranked in the top five in the world"", alongside the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. While the Cape du Couedic wave buoy is BOM's only such device in SA, alternative data is available via a growing number of spotter buoys launched by Flinders University researchers since 2021. This spotter buoy south of Adelaide is funded by Flinders University and the City of Victor Harbor. ( Supplied: Flinders University ) The project, which is running in conjunction with the South Australian Research and Development Institute, SA Water, the Environment Protection Authority and Integrated Marine Observing System, seeks to better inform coastal management and sand drift, and mitigate erosion.

Please let us know The Asian giant hornet is also known as a murder hornet. ( Washington Department of Agriculture via AP: Karla Salp ) A father and son from the United States have died after being stung by a swarm of ""murder hornets"" at a resort in Laos. The pair were taken to a medical clinic showing no signs of allergic reaction, but later died in a regional hospital. A spokesperson for the resort has described the deadly insect attack as an ""unforeseeable and extraordinary natural occurrence"". An American father and son have been stung to death by a swarm of giant hornets during a holiday in Laos. Dan Owen and Cooper, 15, were descending a tree after zip-lining at a resort near the northern city of Luang Prabang when they were attacked by the insects. The incident occurred in October, but was only reported this week. They were taken for treatment ""covered in red spots"" after the ""very, very painful"" attack, Phakan Arocavet Clinic doctor Phanomsay Phakan told The Times . The father and son arrived at the clinic conscious and did not show signs of an allergic reaction. About an hour later, they were taken to a regional hospital where they died. A Green Jungle Park spokesperson told the Straits Times the eco-park had reviewed its procedures. ""This event is unprecedented in our experience and, to our understanding, in Luang Prabang as well,"" the spokesperson said. ""It was an unforeseeable and extraordinary natural occurrence."" In Laos, hornet stings were common but deaths were not, Dr Phakan told The Times. ""I have never seen a death and I have been working more than 20 years,"" he said. Asian giant hornets are a major concern for farmers in North America, who fear important local bee populations will be devastated. Mr Owen, 47, was a director at an international school in Haiphong in Vietnam. ""He was deeply loved across our community and will be profoundly missed,"" the school said in a social media post. ""Our sincere condolences go out to the Owen family and all who knew and loved them."" Asian giant hornets, which are also known as ""murder hornets"", can sting and spit highly toxic venom that causes tissue degeneration, anaphylactic shock and renal failure. They grow to about 5 centimetres long, with stingers about 1cm, and prey on bees and other pollinators. An entomologist told The Guardian being stung was like ""having hot tacks pushed into my flesh"".

Please let us know Crowds arrive at the 2025 AFL grand final, after a season marred by a number of racist incidents. ( ABC News: Danielle Bonica ) Warning: this article contains references to offensive and racist language. Australia's race discrimination commissioner says the AFL is failing in its responsibility to fight against racism aimed at its players. ""If you want to be number one, you should be number one leading work against racism and you're nowhere near that,"" Giridharan Sivaraman told the Indigenous Affairs Team. ""That would be my message to [AFL boss Andrew] Dillon."" Giridharan Sivaraman says the AFL should be leading the fight against racism in sport. ( ABC News: Ian Cutmore ) Mr Sivaraman's comments came in response to Dillon's appearance in the final episode of the ABC's documentary series End Game . Series presenter and former Sydney Swans player Tony Armstrong asked the AFL boss: ""Why is [racism] so hard to combat?"" Dillon told Armstrong racism was ""a societal issue"". ""Maybe it's magnified within the AFL and the sporting arena because of the high-profile nature of it,"" he said. But Mr Sivaramam said the league should be doing more to educate its fans. ""Don't pretend that you don't have influence, don't pretend that you're just part of society,"" he said. ""Accept the responsibility and use that profile and brand to do good."" In May, the AFL removed its executive general manager of inclusion and social policy, Tanya Hosch, as part of a restructure. In an interview for End Game, a tearful Hosch said she ""always said what I think needed to be said"". ""[That's] what I believe the Indigenous leaders that have invested in me for a long time would expect of me,"" she said. Specific reasons for Hosch's departure were not given by Andrew Dillon over several interviews with the ABC, including for the End Game series. ""My commitment and the AFL's commitment to this work is as strong as it ever has been,"" he told Armstrong in episode three. Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars. Mr Sivaraman also questioned the AFL's decision to remove Hosch from the organisation. ""The answers [in End Game] on her redundancy were very unsatisfying and to me, they indicate moving in the opposite direction to fighting racism,"" he said. The AFL subsequently hired Yawuru woman Taryn Lee as general manager, First Nations engagement and inclusion. Yothu Yindi Foundation CEO and Tagalaka woman Denise Bowden sits on the AFL Commission. Since 2021, AFL has mandated development managers for Indigenous players at all clubs. Players in the AFL are regularly subjected to hate speech online and in some cases, in person. Lachie Neale (left) has called out the online abuse aimed at his teammates, including Callum Ah Chee (right). ( AAP: Darren England ) Brisbane Lions co-captain Lachie Neale described these kinds of attacks on players as a ""stain on society"". ""It's getting beyond a joke now, the things I've been sent are some of the most horrific messages I've ever seen,"" he posted on Instagram in April. ""It's a game of football, grow the f*** up."" In July, St Kilda's Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera and Port Adelaide's Jase Burgoyne also called out racist abuse directed at them and their families. Port Adelaide's Willie Rioli deleted his Instagram account in April after a torrent of abuse from users. These are just a handful of incidents from the 2025 season alone. Tony Armstrong presents the End Game documentary on the ABC. ( Supplied by ABC ) In the first episode of End Game, Armstrong, a Gamilaroi man, spoke with the Brisbane Lions' Callum Ah Chee about racist abuse he received in 2022 ""I've been pretty lucky … a lot of boys have had a lot worse, but seeing my wife upset was pretty hard to take."" Callum Ah Chee (centre) is a proud Nyoongar Yawaru Nyikina Palyku man. ( Supplied: Instagram ) The documentary followed Armstrong as he travelled to the UK and US to meet anti-racism campaigners and sportspeople. One of those was Jonathan Hirshler, CEO and co-founder of Signify. Signify describes itself as an ""ethical"" data company and has applied its software to World Cups, Olympics, Wimbledon and the English Premier League. ""Sports organisations are businesses … and they want to protect that brand,"" Mr Hershler told the Indigenous Affairs Team. ""There's a concern: 'Do we have a problem with our fan base; do we have a problem with our brand?'"" Tony Armstrong travelled to London as part of End Game, meeting Signify co-founder Jonathan Hirshler. ( Supplied ) As part of the documentary, Signify analysed the Brisbane Lions's social media accounts across the last two seasons, discovering 148 abusive posts in that period. ""[Posts] that we feel actually break the platform's own guidelines,"" Mr Hirshler said in the program. ""A lot of sexual abuse being sent … the violent abuse is the one we really do focus on. ""Racism runs through all the messages … some of them are really out of order and disgusting."" Signify analysed more than 180,000 posts from Brisbane Lions club and player accounts. ( Supplied ) Signify's software can track abusive posts in real time, potentially detecting a harmful message directed at a player before they have come off the ground. Mr Hirshler said sporting bodies his company dealt with had ""got over"" the idea of dealing with racism as being difficult. ""Their thinking is, the only way to make sure that a brand is protected is to go after this stuff, is to create deterrents and to deal with the problem,"" he said. Now back-to-back premiers, the Brisbane Lions have been trialling Signify this season, though have used this kind of technology before. ""For several years now, we have run and continue to use an AI-powered comment activation platform called Respondology to moderate and track inappropriate comments across our social media channels,"" a spokesperson for the Lions said. ""We want to make social a safer place for all our athletes, so we're investing in technology to be more proactive in protecting them."" The increased social media traffic around the grand final means there would likely be a corresponding increase in abusive messages to players. Fans watch the 2025 AFL grand final outside the MCG. ( ABC News: Danielle Bonica ) The Brisbane Lions said they had banned people from attending matches for ""inappropriate online conduct"" identified by the software and double-checked by human moderators. Andrew Dillon told Tony Armstrong the AFL would be ""judged by our actions"" on racism. Dillon also said he would consider the use of social media monitoring software. The ABC's Indigenous Affairs Team asked the AFL about the progress in this space. General manager of corporate affairs Jay Allen said the league had been working with Finnish software company BrandBastion on AFL accounts since February. ""Through a pre-built banned list of terms, words and emojis, an AI model has been trained to automatically detect a comment that doesn't align with AFL community standards,"" he said. ""In just 8 months, over 2 million comments have been monitored … Of the comments hidden [deleted from public view], 98 per cent have been actioned within 90 seconds."" The AFL did not say how many comments had been hidden and how they failed to meet ""community standards"". However, Allen said the ""success"" of the BrandBastion software meant it would be offered to all 18 clubs, with 12 ""onboarding"" from November 1. Andrew Dillon says combating racism is ""something that we want to work on"". ( ABC: Kyle Harley ) Race discrimination commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said he supported the use of this kind of technology to enable the AFL and its clubs to fulfil their duty of care to players. ""Don't expect them to just endure shocking racism as if it's just part of the job,"" Mr Sivaraman said. The ABC contacted Meta (which runs Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp), YouTube and TikTok to ask about their anti-racism policies. ""Since the beginning of 2024, we have removed more than 10 million videos and more than 35 million comments in Australia for violating our strict Community Guidelines, including those related to racism and bullying,"" a spokesperson for TikTok said. YouTube told the ABC it removed 176,000 videos and terminated 37,000 channels globally for violating its hate speech policies. Meta did not respond to the ABC's request for comment. X had no discernible Australian or global press office for the ABC to contact. Stream all episodes of End Game free on ABC iview or watch on ABC TV at 8.30 pm.

Please let us know Jack Evans is promoting Indigenous language proudly on screen. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) Each week, Behind the News (BTN) presenter and proud Gomeroi man Jack Evans greets a million kids across the country with ""Yaama"" — the Gamilaroi word for hello. ""With our audience, I'm always trying to show that you should be proud of who you are and where you've come from,"" Jack says. This year, alongside the greeting, Jack has found a particularly creative way to bring more of his culture and language on screen with him. Jack Evans's T-shirt designs are making a statement. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) ""I came up with the idea to make a shirt each week that included a word from my mob's language, Gamilaroi or Gomeroi, with a little drawing to go along with it,"" he says. ""As far as we know, I'm the first Indigenous Australian to present the show. ""Knowing that makes me want to amplify it … I'm proud of it and I want people to know that."" Each of Jack's T-shirt designs starts with a Gamilaroi word. ""Usually I will go online and look at different dictionaries,"" he says. ""I pick one that I think will either look cool or I could draw a picture with."" Some designs are quicker to draw than others. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) While some designs take just an afternoon to draw on his tablet, others might be brewing in the background for weeks. ""One that sat there for ages was a boot — just one boot,"" Jack says. ""Then I decided, 'No, there needs to be two boots, and it needs hairy legs.'"" It took Jack Evans some time to get his boots T-shirt to his liking. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) With help from his boyfriend, Joel, the designs are then made into vinyl cut outs and heat pressed onto T-shirts. ""It sort of came from the fact that I had the tools at home to make these shirts and from thinking about what I was going to be wearing each week when I was presenting,"" Jack says. ""I also just thought it was a cool way to sneak a bit of culture into each episode."" Jack did not grow up with any fluent Gamilaroi speakers around him, so this T-shirt project has an added layer of cultural reconnection. ""My grandma, in order to be protected, was denied her identity, so she was told, 'You're white,'"" Jack says. ""It was later in life that she found out things thanks to my auntie, who did a lot of research into our family history and worked out all the connections. ""She [my auntie] has been really instrumental in bringing back that connection."" Jack Evans hopes his T-shirts can play a role in keeping Indigenous language alive. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) Jack's aunt and brother have gone on to study Gamilaroi at TAFE in courses that Jack says play a crucial role in preserving and reviving Indigenous languages. A 2019 survey found that out of 250 Indigenous Australian languages active prior to colonisation, only 12 were still being actively acquired by children. ""Indigenous languages are at threat of being lost and a lot of work is done to make sure that our languages stay and they thrive moving forward,"" Jack says. ""So, this [the T-shirts] can be a little part of that, hopefully. ""If they [the audience] take away just one word, I think that's great."" BTN fans have been taking note of Jack's designs, with some even writing into the show to pitch their own ideas. ""We had one school who teaches Gamilaroi give me a few suggestions,"" Jack says. ""I ended up using one, which is the magpie."" A BTN fan suggested Jack Evans design a magpie T-shirt. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) One school said their favourite part of each BTN episode was seeing what T-shirt Jack was wearing that week. ""For me, it's about being able to connect myself more with my culture and language, so it's nice that that resonates with people,"" Jack says. Asking Jack to choose his favourite T-shirt is like asking him to choose his favourite child. ""Oh, but they're my babies,"" he says, looking through previous designs before landing on one that is a contender for top spot. Jack Evans landed on a ""drag kangaroo"" design. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) Initially, a kangaroo T-shirt was a request from a school. ""I had drawn up a kangaroo, and then Joel [Jack's boyfriend] was like, 'That looks so menacing! That kangaroo looks terrifying!' ""So, I was like, 'OK, how do I make this less terrifying? I'll turn it into a drag kangaroo, because drag isn't terrifying!' ""Now I want to do all the animals as drag."" Jack plans to see out the year creating original T-shirts each week, with the hope that this representation speaks to the young people who watch BTN. Jack Evans is making a new T-shirt each week. ( ABC BTN: Cale Matthews ) ""Everything I do is for my younger self … you want to be that role model that you didn't have,"" Jack says. ""Even just coming here [to BTN] — and realising I was going be on screen and that kids were going to be watching — it made me want to be more authentic to myself. ""It's less about the specifics of the T-shirts themselves, but a way of just showing pride in who you are — whatever culture, wherever you're from, however you identify, whatever it is, be proud of it.""

Please let us know The big map exercise in progress at the City of Swan. ( Supplied: City of Swan ) When Disaster Relief Australia (DRA) comes into a community to run a big map exercise, it is literally that. They print a large, full-colour satellite map of the town or local government area they are working with and invite community members in to walk on it. ""The first thing they say is, 'Oh, that's a big map,'"" said Shari Bent, DRA's associate director. ""But automatically, people are drawn in and they find their house. ""Once they find their house, they take a step back and they start identifying friends and family's houses, and then they start identifying places that they know."" DRA is a veteran-led volunteer organisation that works with communities to prepare for and recover from disasters. The threat of bushfire never occurred to Natasha Turfrey and Denis Grzetic. After all, they lived in a more or less treeless Perth estate — and still do, thanks to sheer chance. Once people have had a good look around their neighbourhood, the serious work starts, using the maps to help people identify risks of flood, fire and storms. ""People walk on the map and go, 'Oh, I didn't realise I had so much bush behind me', or 'I didn't realise there was a river there'. ""It's just a unique, different perspective to understand where they live."" Once they have identified the hazards, DRA teaches people how to access the other information they need to survive and takes a ""military war gaming approach"". ""[In war], they draw maps in the sand and then work through exercises and what might happen and probabilities and that kind of thing,"" Ms Bent said. ""We've taken that theory and applied it to communities."" The City of Swan, in Perth's eastern fringe, did a big map exercise in late 2024 with a 10 by 12-metre map in a community hall. Mayor Tanya Richardson said the map was an amazing visual representation which helped her and the others who used it better understand the topography. ""Swan is topographically so big for a metropolitan council — we have an urban area, but then we also have Gidgegannup and Bullsbrook and bushland areas. ""It really gives you a great bird's-eye view of that map and where the potential risks are, and you're also able to see the navigational lines."" A huge plume of smoke from a bushfire burning in the City of Swan in Perth's hills in March 2024. ( Supplied: Jazzi Sandilands ) Primary school children came into the hall as well and ""had a ball"" finding their homes and the local waterways and landmarks. ""The kids thoroughly enjoyed being able to pinpoint where their home was and to understand where the hills are and where fire sometimes comes from,"" Cr Richardson said. The map, which the city was given to keep, will become a ""fantastic asset"" not just for preparedness, but in helping the community understand what is going on during a bushfire. Cr Richardson anticipates being able to roll out the map at public meetings when a fire hits, showing people where the fire is, where the safe and unsafe roads are and potentially, why they cannot return to their homes yet. ""It's such a visually powerful tool to be able to have for the community,"" she said. ""It can be folded up. It can be taken to be put on the ground. It could be put on an oval, just on a dirt patch — it's portable."" Ms Bent has seen firsthand the difference the big maps can make to disaster readiness. ""There is a little town in New South Wales called Willawarrin that was heavily impacted by the Black Summer fires,"" she said. ""We did a big map [exercise] there and the RFS there took carriage of it, and they run it out every day at their Get Ready weekend. People can come in and walk on the map. ""I was fortunate enough to be present at one of their Get Ready days where we were talking through it. ""And about three weeks after that, they had another large fire and people actually came and said, 'You know, I stood on that map, I saw what was around me and I went and made some changes and did some mitigation and got prepared and that actually saved my house.'"" Shari Bent says has has seen the big map exercise prepare communities for disaster. ( ABC News: Emma Siossian ) For Ms Bent, preparation that mitigates the impacts of disasters on people is everything. She has seen up close the stress and trauma on communities that suffered severe floods and fires. ""I was heavily impacted by Black Summer bushfires and my community was as well,"" she said. ""We can't stop these events happening. They are just getting larger in scale and happening more frequently, and we can't stop them, but we can prepare for them. ""For me, that's what it's about — ensuring that when these things happen, communities are aware, and we lessen the impact.""

Police say conditions can quickly turn and are asking visitors to the alpine regions to be prepared for sudden weather changes. A rescue operation is underway for an 18-year-old man who had been caught in a blizzard near Mount Buller in the Victorian Alps. Emergency services were notified close to 9pm on Tuesday that the man had been caught in the Alpine National Park by the inclement weather. ""Contact was made by satellite phone and he is camped in place,"" a police statement said. ""Police want to remind the community that the weather can change dramatically in the [Alpine region] and to check conditions and warnings prior to their trip."" Police are advising people to be prepared for sudden changes in weather. ( Supplied: Rhylla Morgan ) It is believed the man became stranded on a track south of Mount Buller near Mount McDonald. In a separate incident, emergency services were called to the alpine resort before 6pm to help a 49-year-old woman who was unable to continue hiking. Crews reached the woman before midnight and she was transported to Mansfield. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) told Victorian Statewide Mornings that Mount Buller topped the list of the heaviest rainfall in Victoria over the 24 hours up to 9am, recording 46 millimetres. ""Certainly it is cold enough that any of the rainfall falling up in the mountains late yesterday and today may well be falling as snow,"" said BOM weather forecaster Christie Johnson. Mount Buller spokesperson Rhylla Morgan said locals had been surprised by the sudden snowfall, but the event was not unusual.

Please let us know Local students getting a look at the wreck with Solitary Islands Marine Park ranger David Greenhalgh. ( Supplied: Ballina Coast High School ) Wood taken from a 150-year-old shipwrecked vessel has revealed its country of origin. Timbers from the vessel washed up or were exposed by sand erosion at Ballina in northern NSW in April. Local historians would like an offshore reef to be explored for more parts of the mystery vessel. Archaeologists working to unravel the history of a shipwreck exposed on a beach in northern New South Wales during Cyclone Alfred have discovered the vessel is likely of North American origin. Timber from the wreck surfaced briefly at Ballina's Shelly Beach in 2023, and then again in March this year during the ex-tropical cyclone. Heritage New South Wales senior maritime archaeologist Brad Duncan said the effects of the weather event were like ""Christmas"" for people in his line of work. ""Anytime we get something new in it's exciting for us,"" Dr Duncan said. ""It's adding a new piece to the puzzle of what's gone on, not only for the local area but the history of maritime expansion within New South Wales."" Erosion caused by Cyclone Alfred exposed the wreckage. ( Supplied: Ballina Shire Council ) A 1-centimetre cube of wood was taken from the wreck and delivered to timber expert Jugo Ilic, who determined the ship had been built from North American species birch, larch and white oak. Testing showed the timber could have originated from temperate North America, which encompasses ship-building regions including Maine, Nova Scotia and Brunswick. The wood showed it was also possible that the ship had been built in the United Kingdom. Dr Duncan said maritime records showed more than 100 ships were wrecked along the northern New South Wales coastline. But this key piece of evidence narrowed the search for the vessel's identity to just 13 vessels wrecked around the Richmond River between the 1850s and the 1870s — 10 from North America and three from the United Kingdom. ""You have to use scientific methods, archaeological methods, and historical documentation to try to work out what these vessels may be."" The wreckage drew hundreds of curious people to the beach in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, prompting Ballina Shire Council and Heritage New South Wales to act quickly to re-bury the timbers. Machinery was brought onto the beach to rebury the wreck. ( Supplied: Ballina Shire Council ) Machinery was brought onto the beach to dig a 2-metre hole in the intertidal zone so the wood would remain damp and not exposed to air. Dr Duncan said fully identifying the shipwreck might rely on more pieces of the vessel turning up. Curator and manager of the Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum, Ron Creber, said he would like to see an expedition mounted to explore a reef located about 800 metres north of the Ballina breakwater. Mr Crebar said it was possible the timbers found on the beach had broken off a larger section of wreckage still lodged in the reef. Heritage New South Wales was concerned the wrecked timbers would be damaged or swept out to sea. ( Supplied: Mark Callinan ) ""I believe the southerly buster that's come up has broken it off because some of it was freshly broken and brought in to shore,"" he said. ""It definitely wasn't in the sand. All that area was sand mined and gold mined for years, so it would have been exposed long before that."" Mr Crebar said it would be a difficult dive due to the strong currents and wave action, but worth it to unravel the mystery. ""I retired from paid work 20 years ago, but I'm still here at the museum — this is my joy.""

Please let us know Shane Love is calling on the state government to invest in further water infrastructure upgrades. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers ) Residents in Western Australia's Murchison say they are unsatisfied with water quality despite multi-million-dollar infrastructure upgrades completed three years ago. Nationals WA leader Shane Love has called on the state government to invest further in the region's infrastructure. The Water Corporation says infrastructure is not due for an upgrade, and water quality met guidelines in regular testing. A group of local governments in Western Australia's Murchison has backed calls for further investment in water infrastructure due to issues with the quality of scheme water. Mid-West MP Shane Love told parliament last month that residents in Sandstone, Mount Magnet, Cue and Yalgoo had approached him with concerns about the quality of drinking water. The Water Corporation assured residents their drinking water was safe and compliant with Australian standards and said any claims to the contrary were false. Additionally, the spokesperson pointed to recent investment in the region. ""Salinity, hardness and nitrates in drinking water supplied to Murchison communities has improved significantly since the completion of a $25.7 million program in 2022,"" a spokesperson said. ""This work saw specialised Electrodialysis Reversal plants built in Meekatharra, Mount Magnet, Cue and Sandstone."" Despite the upgrades, Sandstone resident Jeff Hargrave said he still chose to drink bottled water. ""The first thing I notice is the skin on top of the coffee … that's the first sign it's starting to go bad,"" he said. ""When I have a shower, my eyes start to sting. ""Our ice machine, even with the filter, still completely clogs up full of a white film."" Shane Love showed this ice scoop in parliament when discussing Murchison water. ( Supplied ) Sandstone resident Ian Sumption said he would not drink the water and had raised concerns with the shire. ""I can't even get my tomato plants to germinate, everything that was being watered just died,"" he said. Unlike many residents, Mr Sumption does not have access to a bore and said he made regular trips to a local rainwater tank. ""I go up there two or three times a week in summer,"" he said. Some residents get their water from the Sandstone rainwater tank. ( Supplied ) Mr Sumption said he decided to enquire about filtration with water treatment company Puretec last year and sent a sample of his tap water for testing. ""I rang up the water treatment mob and they said I had to test the water to find out what sort of filter I needed,"" Mr Sumption said. ""When the results came back, I was told the water was not fit for human consumption."" The Water Corporation said it was aware of water filtration companies that were active in the area. ""As part of their sales pitch, these companies often perform rudimentary testing of tap water,"" the spokesperson said. ""From past experience, the results provided to residents can differ wildly from the verified quality of water supplied to meter. Puretec sales engineer Burke Stacey said discrepancies could occur between the meter and water delivered at the tap, but testing was not a sales tactic. ""We referred the client back to Water Corporation because we noted a disparity between our results and theirs,"" Mr Stacey said. Shortly after the upgrades, Cue was named as having the state's best tasting tap water. However, Shire President Les Price said issues remained and upgrading pipe systems could help. Les Price says water pipeline upgrades would help water quality. ( ABC Midwest Wheatbelt: Rachael Clifford ) ""A big part of the problem that does exist is in relation to the pipes and delivery systems of water into the town and into the homes,"" he said. ""An upgrade on the piping system within the town sites will improve water over time."" Sandstone Shire President Beth Walton agreed an infrastructure update may be needed. Although she said residents' reactions to the water varied. ""All we can do is be in touch with the Water Corp and make sure those standards are delivered to us,"" she said. A Water Corperation spokesperson said pipeline infrastructure in Cue and Sandstone were within their expected asset lifespan and did not have faults which would require them to be replaced.

Please let us know Jake Weatherald remains a chance of making his debut in the first Ashes Test after being named in Australia's squad. ( Getty Images: Steve Bell ) Australia has named its squad for the first Ashes Test, but is no closer to knowing who will open the batting in Perth on November 21. Look back at how ABC readers and other Australians responded to this live moment. In short, Sam Konstas has been dropped, Jake Weatherald is a chance to open, but whether he does likely depends on how Cameron Green bowls in the Shield for WA next week. Marnus Labuschagne is back, Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett are both in contention for a quick bowler slot. Three uncapped players, Weatherald, Abbott and Doggett. Plenty of experience. Plenty of hype ahead of the Ashes. i am surprised of the selection of Jake Weatherald becuase of his recent form hasnt been amazing, but i think Mat Renshaw will fill in Usman Khawaja spot once he retires. Khawaja has not been amazing in recent series for Australia. Should he fail a couple of times in this series, you do wonder whether there will be some calls for a tough decision to be made. Jake Weatherald is one of three uncapped players to have been included in a 15-man squad alongside Marnus Labuschagne, who are both a chance to partner Usman Khawaja at the top of the order. ""His performance over the last 18 months has been really solid,"" chief selector George Bailey said of Weatherald on the Gold Coast. ""There's a method there that we like and is really complimentary to the other players around him in the squad."" Both Cameron Green and Beau Webster have been named as all rounders with uncertainty remaining over Green's potential bowling loads. Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett are the back-up bowlers with Pat Cummins unavailable and Josh Inglis is the reserve wicketkeeper. Sam Konstas has been left out of the squad, and there was no place for Matt Renshaw who had also staked a claim. ""I feel for Sammy. I feel like at the moment if he farts, it's a headline,"" Bailey said. ""There's a handful of young guys his age playing Shield cricket around the country and they're all learning … Sammy's no different, he just happens to be doing it under immense scrutiny. ""We really like him. We like the skill set there and we're confident that will continue to build out."" George Bailey announced the Australian squad on the Gold Coast. ( Getty Images: Robert Cianflone ) Skipper Pat Cummins has already been ruled out of contention due to a back injury, with Steve Smith set to captain the side. Cummins said he hopes to be fit in time for the second Test in Brisbane on December 4, with Bailey confirming he was bowling at the moment and would likely be fit to play at the Gabba. England named its 16-man squad for the Ashes tour in September , led by Ben Stokes and a battery of injury-prone fast bowlers including Jofra Archer and Mark Wood. The Ashes gets underway at Perth Stadium on November 21, followed by Tests in Brisbane (December 4-8), Adelaide (December 17-21), Melbourne (December 26-30) and Sydney (January 4-8). Australia has never played England in a Test match at Perth Stadium but has an overall record of four wins and one defeat in its five Tests at the venue since 2018. England has only ever won a single Test in 14 attempts in Perth, a 166-run victory at the W.A.C.A. in 1978. Australia has been victorious on 10 occasions in Western Australia against the English, with three draws. England have not won a Test match on Australian soil since 2011. Australia's Ashes squad (first Test) : Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitch Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster. England's Ashes squad : Ben Stokes (c), Harry Brook (vc), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk), Josh Tongue, Mark Wood. Before the announcement, former Australian skipper Steve Waugh called on Bailey to make some ""tough calls"" over the make up of this Ashes squad due to the ages of some of Australia's established stars. ""It is a time of transition,"" Waugh said at the SCG, where the Ashes trophy tour was presented. ""The bowlers are in their 30s and some of the batsmen are getting on as well. That's natural for every team. Steve Waugh said George Bailey needed to make some tough decisions. ( ABC News: John Gunn ) ""You just want to make sure that three or four players don't go out at the same time. That leaves a big hole in the team. ""So they've got to just make sure that it is a transition, but not all at once."" Australia was caught out by the retirements of a bevvy of stars after the 2006/07 series, including Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. The Australians ended up winning just two of the subsequent 15 Tests as England claimed the urn in three successive series. ""I think in the past he's shown he [Bailey] hasn't really had the appetite for that at times,"" Waugh said. ""So he's going to have to step up to the plate with the other selectors."" Waugh also criticised how vocal players have been about who should be named in the squad, saying ""that's the selectors' job."" ""I'd like to see the selectors pick the sides, not the players,"" Waugh said. ""There's been a lot of players recently picking sides and saying who should be in the team."" Bailey responded by saying ""they weren't in the selection meeting"" in relation to the players. He did, however, confirm that he was ""aware"" of the age profile of the team and that the inclusion of players in both senior and A squads in recent years was to address that. ""I'm interested as to when people have that view would they like us to leave Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Starc out, is it just because their age?"" Bailey said. ""I think you have to have respect that these guys work incredibly hard to play Test cricket.""

Please let us know A wide-body UPS cargo plane has crashed during take-off at an airport in Kentucky, leaving three people dead and 11 injured. Kentucky's governor said the number of fatalities could rise. US air safety authorities have launched an investigation. Louisville International Airport, home to a major UPS cargo hub, has closed the airfield. Three people have died and 11 others are injured after a UPS cargo plane crashed while taking off from Louisville International Airport in the US state of Kentucky. The crash occurred about 5:15pm, local time, on Tuesday as the plane was departing for Honolulu, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. A massive fire was ignited, leaving a thick plume of black smoke over the area. Video showed flames on the plane's left wing. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear confirmed the casualties and said there could be more. ""We believe we have at least three fatalities. I believe that number is going to get larger,"" he said in a Tuesday evening press briefing. The Louisville airport is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the delivery firm's air cargo operations and its largest package handling facility in the world. The crash will likely disrupt deliveries for UPS, and its major customers, including Amazon and the United States Postal Service. Mayor Craig Greenberg told WLKY-TV there could be about 1,059 kilolitres of fuel on the plane, an ""extreme reason for concern in so many different ways"". The plane, carrying more than 1,000 kilolitres of fuel, exploded after the crash. ( AP: Brad Harvey ) UPS's largest package handling facility is in Louisville. The hub employs thousands of workers, has 300 daily flights and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour. The Louisville airport is only a 10-minute drive from the city's downtown, which sits on the river bordering the Indiana state line. There are residential areas, a water park and museums in the area. The Louisville airport said the airfield was closed after the incident, while the Louisville Metro Police Department said it was responding to reports of a plane crash and that injuries had been reported. According to FAA records, the MD-11 freighter involved in the crash was 34 years old. Boeing BA.N, which owns the MD-11 program, declined to comment. FlightRadar24 said the plane, which began operations with UPS in 2006, had flown from Louisville to Baltimore earlier on Tuesday before returning to Louisville. The flight from Louisville to Honolulu typically takes eight-and-a-half hours, the flight tracking service said.

Cheney died from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease on Monday night at the age of 84, his family said in a statement. He became one of the most powerful US vice-presidents in history under Bush, and leaves behind a controversial legacy as a key architect of the ""war on terror"", and an early advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ""History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation,"" Bush said in a statement. Cheney was ""a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held"", Bush added. ""I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best. He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people."" Condoleezza Rice, who served as Secretary of State alongside Cheney in the Bush administration, said she admired him ""for his integrity and his love of our country"". ""He was an inspiring presence and mentor who taught me a great deal about public service,"" she wrote on X. Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said: ""Though we often disagreed, I always respected his dedication to our country and his unwavering sense of duty."" Despite being a stalwart figure in the Republican party for many years, Cheney became a bitter critic of it under the leadership of Donald Trump. The president has yet to comment on his death, but the White House says Trump is ""aware"" of it. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said: ""Scripture is very clear, we give honour where honour is due."" ""Even when we had political differences as somebody later in life, you have to honour the sacrifices and the service they gave to their country,"" he said. Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff on Tuesday morning, shortly after his death was announced. In their statement announcing his death, Cheney's family said that he was a ""great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honour, love, kindness, and fly fishing"". Cheney was a controversial political figure, particularly in his role behind the ""war on terror"", which saw the US invade Iraq in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Iraqi writer Sinan Antoon said that Cheney's lasting legacy in the country is of ""chaos and terrorism"". ""In a different world Dick Cheney would definitely be a war criminal and would be standing trial,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Kristofer Goldsmith, a US Army veteran who was deployed to Iraq, also told the BBC that ""most people recognise Dick Cheney as someone who created a massive problem that ended up in hundreds of thousands of deaths."" Richard ""Dick"" Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1941 and later attended the prestigious Yale University on a scholarship but failed to graduate. He went on to gain a Master's degree in political science from the University of Wyoming. His first taste of Washington came in 1968, when he worked for William Steiger, a young Republican representative from Wisconsin. Cheney became chief of staff under Gerald Ford in 1975, when he was just 34 years old, before spending a decade in the House of Representatives. As secretary of defence under George Bush Snr, he presided over the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Gulf War, in which a US-led coalition evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait. He became VP to George W Bush in 2001, and played a greater role in making major policy decisions than most of his predecessors. It is for this role that he will be remembered best and most controversially. During the younger Bush's administration, he singlehandedly turned his role as vice-president from what was traditionally an empty role, with little formal power, into a de-facto deputy presidency, overseeing American foreign policy and national security in the wake of the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001. He was a leading advocate of US military action in both Afghanistan and Iraq. In the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Cheney said that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed so-called weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons were never found during the military campaign. He also repeatedly claimed there were links between Iraq and al-Qaeda, the terror group led by Osama bin Laden that claimed responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. He said the attackers would incur the ""full wrath"" of American military might. Cheney's key role in the campaign heavily affected his political legacy, after the US took years to extricate itself from its costly war in Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. His political career later became the subject of a major feature film in 2018's Vice - with actor Christian Bale receiving a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the former vice-president. Cheney had numerous heart problems throughout his life. He suffered the first of many heart attacks in 1978, when he was just 37. Cheney was campaigning for a seat in the House of Representatives at the time - and smoking three packets of cigarettes a day. In 2010 he underwent surgery to install a small heart pump to try to combat ""increasing congestive heart failure"". At this point he had already suffered five heart attacks. Two years later, Cheney had a full heart transplant. He is survived by his wife Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney, and seven grandchildren. Despite decades working for Republican presidents, he became a bitter opponent of President Donald Trump. Having initially endorsed him in 2016, Cheney was appalled by allegations of Russian interference in the presidential election and Trump's seemingly casual attitude towards Nato. He supported his older daughter, Liz, as she became a leading Republican ""never Trump"" in the House of Representatives - and condemned the refusal to accept the result of the 2020 election. Two months before last year's US presidential election, Cheney staged a major intervention: announcing that he would vote for the Democrats' Kamala Harris. He said there had ""never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump"". In return, Trump called Cheney ""irrelevant RINO"" - an acronym which stands for ""Republican in name only"". Reacting to Cheney's death, Harris said ""his passing marks the loss of a figure who, with a strong sense of dedication, gave so much of his life to the country he loved."" In his final years, Cheney would become a persona non grata in his own party, which had been reshaped in Trump's image. In an odd final twist, his own Trump criticism - and endorsement of Harris - would win him praise from some on the left who had once denounced him decades earlier.

The 19-year-old soldier's remains were returned on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month. ""Following the completion of the identification process... IDF representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,"" the Israeli prime minister's office said. Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City. Israel had allowed members of the group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces. Chen was working at his base on the Gaza border when Hamas and its allies launched their attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023. His family lost communication with him after he told them his base was under attack. Chen was initially believed to have been taken hostage by jihadists was actually killed in the 7 October attacks, the Israeli military said in March 2024. It said he had died in combat and his body had been taken to Gaza. The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since a US-brokered ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October. Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble. Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours. All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese. Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Earlier on Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza. The Israeli military said its troops killed a ""terrorist"" who had crossed the ""Yellow Line"", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them. The bodies were identified as those of Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, the Israeli prime minister's office said. Demonstrators take to the streets over changes to an exemption from military service in one of the biggest protests of its kind for years. The operation, which Israel says was aimed at Hezbollah, draws a furious response from the Lebanese government.

Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads. From 10 December, tech companies can be fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take ""reasonable steps"" to deactivate existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones. Each banned platform was chosen as their ""sole or a significant purpose is to enable online social interaction,"" the government said, and more sites may be added given the ""fast-changing"" nature of technology. ""Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,"" said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids. Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with ""chilling control"" and the ban was about protecting children. ""We aren't chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,"" she said. It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or shortcomings . Most Australian adults support the ban, according to polls, but some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet. Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web. An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube follower recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content. YouTube was initially exempt from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision , saying the video sharing site was ""the most frequently cited platform"" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw ""harmful content"". Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.

Typhoon Kalmaegi has flooded large areas, including entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where most fatalities occurred. Thirteen others are missing. Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets. The official death toll excludes the six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island south of Cebu after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts. The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help. ""Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,"" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew. The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h). It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday. ""The situation in Cebu is really unprecedented,"" provincial governor Pamela Baricuatro said in a Facebook post. ""We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,"" she said. ""The floodwaters are just devastating."" Baricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts. Most of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities. Damage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses. Don del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged. ""I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,"" he told the AFP news agency. In total, almost 400,000 people were moved from the typhoon's path, Rafaelito Alejandro, deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence, told a news conference. The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year. The latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops. Super Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong. In the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding, sparking anger and protests over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption. On 30 September, dozens were killed and injured after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage. Typhoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall. With additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent Rob Cuff from Snedshill in Shropshire had been on honeymoon in Jamaica when the hurricane struck. Calls are being made by London Fire Brigade for more investment in climate change resilience. At least three people have died, officials say. Residents sought shelter from high water on rooftops. The Grammy-winning reggae singer says the storm was ""very frightening, especially for my young kids"". Councillor Dan Hurcomb says the design aims to keep residents and buildings in Hereford safe.

Zelensky posted photos showing him meeting personnel at a command post in the Dobropillya sector, some 20km (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Kyiv's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskiy, said on Monday that Ukraine was increasing pressure on the Dobropillya front to ""force the enemy to disperse its forces and make it impossible to concentrate their main efforts in the Pokrovsk area"". Russia has been trying to seize Pokrovsk - a strategic frontline town and logistic hub - for over a year. Although it has taken them months to approach the town's borders, Russian soldiers have now infiltrated it and on Friday, Zelensky said Russia had amassed 170,000 troops on its outskirts. Both Ukraine and Russia continue to issue claims and counter claims on the situation in and around Pokrovsk. Capturing Pokrovsk could give Moscow access to the rest of Donetsk, including the towns Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - the so-called ""fortress belt"". Gen Syrskiy, acknowledged his troops were withstanding the ""pressure of a multi-thousand enemy grouping"" but denied they were encircled. Meanwhile, Russian military bloggers claimed 90% of Pokrovsk was under Moscow's control. Unverified videos posted on social media show instances of close quarter combat, drone attacks and street battles there. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Russian forces were operating with ""increasing comfort"" within the town, which once had a population of 60,000 but has now been almost entirely emptied of civilians and largely destroyed. Further east, Moscow's troops are also reportedly targeting the town of Myrnohrad, which would put Ukrainian soldiers at risk of encirclement. Intense drone activity has cut off many logistics routes, making evacuations and the supply of ammunition and vehicles near impossible. On Monday, Zelensky said Russia had had ""no success"" in Pokrovsk in recent days but acknowledged that ""things were not easy"" for Ukrainian forces in the area. He added that a third of all front line clashes were happening in Pokrovsk, and a half of all glide bombs used by the Russians were launched at the town. Earlier last week the Ukrainian president said that Moscow's troops in the area were outnumbering Kyiv's eight to one. Some Ukrainian commentators have criticised the government's efforts to continue to defend Pokrovsk, arguing that troops were being put at risk. In a post accompanying the pictures of his visit to Dobropillya, Zelensky on Tuesday wrote: ""This is our country, this is our East, and we will certainly do our utmost to keep it Ukrainian."" Russia now controls 81% of the Donetsk region and 99% of neighbouring Luhansk, which collectively make up the Donbas. Moscow has never relented in its ambition to capture the entirety of the area, which Russia's President Vladimir Putin declared annexed in 2022 despite not being in full control of it. However, its progress along the front line has been grinding and occupying the heavily fortified towns in northern Donetsk could come at a huge cost of both manpower and resources. Away from the front line, Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities, targeting the country's energy facilities as winter draws in. A large-scale drone attack overnight Monday targeted the southern port of Odesa on the Black Sea, damaging industrial facilities, causing fires and affecting the local power supply. At least 15 civilians were killed and 44 injured in combined drone and missile attacks across the country at the weekend. Ukraine continues to hit back, mostly using drones to target industrial sites across Russia and border regions. On Tuesday, Kyiv said it had attacked a petrochemical plant in the Bashkortostan region and a refinery in the Nizhny Novgorod region, while earlier this week, a drone explosion killed a woman and injured three others in the Russian border region of Belgorod. The capture of Pokrovsk could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. The unamed Briton passed information to Russia while working as a military instructor, prosecutors say. Ukraine's president confirms Russian soldiers have taken up position inside the town of Pokrovsk. A large gulf remains between the US and European view of how to end the Ukraine war. At least 32 others were injured in the attack, including six children, the city's mayor says. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The semi-submersible vessel was bound for the Iberian peninsula and was seized in recent days, according to officials. Footage shows the police and navy surrounding the vessel before boarding, seizing the Class A substance and arresting four crew members, who are said to be from South America. The suspects, including two Ecuadorians, a Venezuelan and a Colombian, were remanded in pre-trial custody after their court appearance in the Azores on Tuesday, said police. Vítor Ananias, head of Portugal's police unit to combat drug trafficking, told a press conference that their different nationalities showed the organisation behind them was not just based in one country. The Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (MAOC) said it had received information in recent days indicating that a criminal organisation was in the process of dispatching a submersible loaded with cocaine destined for Europe. A few days later, a Portuguese ship successfully located the submersible approximately 1,000 nautical miles (1,852km) off the coast of Lisbon, in an operation backed by the UK's National Crime Agency and the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Having seized the vessel, the navy said it could not be towed back to shore due to poor weather and its fragile construction, and it later sank in the open sea. Vítor Ananias told reporters that ""between the heat, the vessel's fumes and high waves, with difficult weather conditions, even one day is tricky [for the four men on board]. By the end of 15 or 20 days all you want is to get out"". Such incidents like these had been a ""recurring situation in recent years"", he added, in remarks quoted by Lusa news agency. In March this year, a similar vessel carrying 6.5 tonnes of cocaine was seized about 1,200 nautical miles from Lisbon. It also comes as the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on vessels it says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US. Three men were killed last week in a US strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday. Experts have questioned the legality of such strikes under international law and they have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted. Inga Ruginiene says she is taking the ""strictest measures"" over the balloons, used to transport cigarettes from Belarus. A preliminary report says a cable that broke on the Glória funicular last month had never been certified, and mentions other failures. The Pakistani convict called himself a ""walking dead person"" just days before his last voyage destined for Houthi rebels in Yemen. A judge says the five Albanians had a ""serious list of convictions"" for drugs and violence. The two men are found guilty of assisting unlawful immigration at Ipswich Crown Court.

bc92230e37c7c539,www.bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd04yde70jmo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,Carney plans billions in new spending in response to US tariff shocks,"Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:17:44 GMT","Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs. Billed an ""investment budget"" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history. The spending is offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate ""vital social programmes"" and funding for Canada's future. The budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years. The budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon. In his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing ""a time of profound change"" and that ""bold and swift action is needed"" to ensure the country prospers. Peppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles. These levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty. To counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years ""to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience"". These include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs. The fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US. Rebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years. But she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living. ""They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),"" she said. And while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as ""transformational"" as Carney hopes. ""We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,"" she said. On defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year. The Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations. Carney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of ""sacrifices"". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels. Immigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to ""stabilise"" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas. The budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan. Failure to pass the budget could risk a federal election. One Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party. In the statement, the MP said that the budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“. ​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time. Meanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget. Members of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts. With the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan. Both the former Canadian prime minister and the California Girl singer have been through high and lows of public opinion. Finding it hard to reach a resolution of its trade dispute with the US after Trump suspended talks, Canada turns to other major economies. Trump's volatile trade policy has thrown the world economy into chaos, and put some US prices up. The tense exchange happened after an anti-tariff commercial aired by Ontario infuriated the Trump administration. The advert was viewed one billion times as Trump said he has no plans to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Carney. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Air traffic there was suspended around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) after a drone sighting. An hour later it briefly reopened, before closing again shortly after. Liege Airport has also been affected and it is not clear when flights will resume. Local media also reported drone sightings at the Kleine-Brogel and Florennes military airbases, local media reports. It is the latest in a string of suspected drone sightings causing disruption at European airports - including in Munich, Copenhagen and Oslo. A statement on the Brussels Airport website on Tuesday evening read: ""There are currently no departing or arriving flights at Brussels Airport due to drone sightings around the airport. ""We monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as soon as we have more information."" Pictures taken inside the airport show what appear to be camp beds being readied for passengers. Officials at Brussels's second-largest airport, Charleroi, said air traffic was briefly halted there as a precaution too. Local media reports flights had initially been diverted to Liege - before that also closed due to suspected drone sightings. It adds that flights have since been diverted to nearby airports - including Ostend and Charleroi in Belgium, and Eindhoven and Maastricht in the Netherlands. Tuesday was the fourth night in a row that the Belgian authorities reported drone sightings over Kleine-Brogel, a major military base near the Dutch border. Belgium's defence minister, Theo Francken, said on Monday that an investigation was under way, calling it ""a clear mission targeting Kleine Broge"". Drones were also seen close to Ostend and Antwerp's Deurne airports over the weekend, according to Belgian news site VRT. The proposals are part of the airport's plans to double annual passenger numbers by 2043. Plans for landing lights for long-haul flights could mean the loss of some common land nearby. The Guernsey airline says it uses services from ""many providers"" to ensure services run. Viswashkumar Ramesh describes the pain and anguish he is enduring despite surviving the disaster. The airport writes to 25,000 households about the works, which will last for five months. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Known as GP, Mr Hinduja and his family made their fortune from the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, which operates in 11 sectors including finance, media and entertainment, and oil. It has about 200,000 staff around the world. The family said in a statement: ""He will leave a deep hole at the heart of our family."" They added that he would be ""remembered for his formidable work"". Mr Hinduja helped transform his father's modest textile and trading businesses into a global conglomerate and one of India's largest companies. Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, said he would be remembered as someone who ""personified"" the links between India and the UK. ""Whether it was in banking, whether it was in manufacturing, whether it was in property, they were always putting the UK and India together ""GP was not only a famous and respected individual in the UK and India but a great champion for our two countries. We shall miss him greatly."" Mr Hinduja and his family topped the most recent Sunday Times Rich List with a net worth of £35.3bn. They also ranked 11th on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest businesspeople in 2024. Mr Hinduja was the second eldest of four brothers who controlled the business for decades. The oldest of the four, Srichand, died in 2023 at 87. It is not known who will now take over the leadership of the conglomerate. The youngest brother, Ashok, runs its operations across India including truck maker Ashok Leyland. The Hinduja conglomerate operates in 48 countries. The family also own significant real estate in London, including a number of large homes near to St James's Park and Winston Churchill's Old War Office in Whitehall, which has recently been refurbished to include a hotel. Mr Hinduja largely kept out of the public eye but was involved in the controversial ""Hinduja affair"" in 2001. Mr Hinduja had written to Mandelson about his brother Prakash obtaining British citizenship, after the family's charity had donated £1m to the Millennium Dome, for which Mandelson was responsible. Mandelson resigned as a minister as a result, but was later cleared of wrongdoing after an inquiry. Prakash, his wife, their son and his wife were jailed by a Swiss court last year for exploiting domestic staff in their Geneva mansion. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Cécile Kohler, 41 and her partner Jacques Paris, 72, have been released from Evin prison, Macron said on Tuesday, with France's foreign minister later confirming they were ""safe"" at the embassy in Tehran ""ahead of their final release"". ""I welcome this first step. The dialogue continues to allow for their return to France as quickly as possible,"" Macron said. The pair, who were arrested in May 2022 during a tourist trip, are believed to be the last French nationals held in Iran. Last month, they were found guilty of spying on behalf of both France and Israel, and were handed lengthy prison sentences, according to Iranian state media reports. A number of Europeans have been held by Iran in recent years. France has accused Iran of state hostage-taking and keeping its nationals in conditions akin to torture, something Tehran has denied. In a statement to the AFP news agency on Tuesday, the pair's Paris-based legal team said the release of Kohler and Paris had ""ended their arbitrary detention which lasted 1,277 days"". AFP said their families have insisted they are wholly innocent. Their freeing comes more than a month after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a deal to exchange French detainees for an Iranian woman held in France was nearly complete. Iran had said Kohler and Paris could be released as part of that agreement. Mahdieh Esfandiari, who has been held in France since February on charges of promoting terrorism on social media, was released conditionally by French authorities last month. The national security threats China poses today go beyond traditional notions of espionage - in this new world, threats are far more complex Lindsay and her husband, Craig Foreman, were arrested in January while travelling the world.

e69950cfafde0925,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/05/radiohead-live-review-movistar-arena-madrid-spain-thom-yorke,Radiohead review – bards of the apocalypse return for a brutal bacchanal,"Wed, 05 Nov 2025 01:19:36 GMT","Powered by a pounding rhythm section, the crowd dance to even the tricksiest drum patterns at Radiohead’s first gig in seven years – one that demonstrates the pure joy this band can bring A lmost 10 years have passed since Radiohead released a new record, and more than seven since they were last seen on stage. Living through that period has felt like moving further and faster into the future that their songs often sounded so worried about. Animal-borne diseases and invading armies, bomb shelters and endless rainstorms, falling skies and collapsing infrastructure – ’twas all foretold in the lyric sheets of the ever-fretful Thom Yorke . His reputation as a soothsayer has probably been overstated as the band’s myth has grown in their absence, but if the frontman is a genius (the jury is still out and may never come back in, their verdict deferred more by politics than musicianship) then he’s hardly the only monumental talent in the lineup. For all the brilliant records Yorke has made lately, including several with bandmate Jonny Greenwood in their looser-limbed trio the Smile, the faithful have been holding out a geological age to see the full five back together. Now, without much warning, nor any particular reason, nor any new music to sell us (that we know of), they have returned to play short residencies in a few European cities . Performing in the round, they take and switch positions behind a gossamer projection screen that initially seems like some kind of shield. As it turns out, no such protection is needed. This is not a fragile re-emergence. “Shell smashed, juices flowing,” sings Yorke on opener Let Down, and it makes sense that they would start again with that one. A deep cut from OK Computer that has long been a fan favourite, its recent adoption by teens on TikTok gave the band their closest thing to a big hit this century. Gorgeous, oddly weightless, gently self-mocking – Yorke’s mordant joking about his own tendency towards maudlin “drivel” might be as under-recognised as Kafka’s – it strikes a peculiar note of hope-against-doubt, bequeathed from gen X to gen Z. On this outing, the shimmer of the vocal and Greenwood’s curious guitar melody (played in a different time signature to the other instruments) are given colossal oomph by an almost overpowering rhythm section. This sets the tone for the night, too, as the top end sometimes suffers from the cavern effect common to arenas of this size, while drummer Phil Selway, auxiliary percussionist Clive Deamer, and Jonny’s bassist brother Colin compensate with a stunning show of force on mid-to-late career tracks 2+2=5, Bloom and Ful Stop. The elder Greenwood has always been Radiohead’s secret weapon, his manner suggesting the offer of a nice cuppa while his playing can range from loverman soulfulness to borderline brutality. His basslines have walked the listener through the most forbidding passages of their studio material and tonight’s selections from Kid A – Everything In Its Right Place, Idioteque – complete their 25-year transition from icy sonic shocks to crowd-pleasing, floor-filling heaters. By 15 Step even the upper tiers of seated sections are bouncing like babies to those tricky drum patterns while Yorke reminds them that “it comes to us all”, whatever “it” is. Old age … or death, most likely. Yorke is almost 60 now and spry as hell, but also grey-bearded as a sea dog while he dances little jigs around the deck to The National Anthem and its stupidly great bassline, which he apparently wrote when he was 16. Yorke has always kept one eye on the prancing spectres of elders like Mick Jagger, and one ear out for the sound of legacy acts spinning their wheels. That is absolutely not how Radiohead come across here. Their fanbase is more prone to purism and perversity than others, maybe, and some will inevitably quibble about the relative lack of choice picks from albums A Moon Shaped Pool or The Bends, though beloved early-ish single Fake Plastic Trees “blows through the ceiling” on that line much more explosively than on the recorded version. In the past, live performance has expressed Radiohead’s clear relief at being out of the studio, and alleviated of the compositional pressure that seemed to almost wreck them every time. Their energy tonight might mean something else, but the relief is surely felt by anyone who ever loved this band – it’s not just fun, it’s an absolute joy. Yorke, for his part, says little other than “gracias”. There are many who feel he should have said a lot more, and a lot louder, in recent years . And there are others who remember well the nervy young guy who seemed so freaked out by the speed and direction of our supposed progress back in the early days of the iMac, who would still elect him as the very fellow to sing to us in our present state of terminal velocity.

The RBA monetary policy board surprised nobody on Melbourne Cup day when it held its cash rate target at 3.6%. It was probably the safest bet in town after inflation came in far hotter than anticipated in the September quarter, which reset expectations for where it will go through 2026. At Michele Bullock’s post-meeting press conference, attention naturally turned to one question: what’s next for Australia’s mortgage-stretched homeowners?. But the central bank’s governor gave little sign that the RBA has any answers there, plumping for a post-match cliche that the board was taking it “meeting by meeting”. For homeowners, it would be best to assume that there’s no further interest rate cuts from here, and that there’s some small chance of a hike . What we do know is that the central bank now doesn’t think inflation will be back in its 2 to 3% target range until 2027. By then, consumer price growth will have spent almost all of the preceding five years above 3%, which can’t be seen as a great outcome. Inflation is going to accelerate to 3.7% by the middle of next year and only get back below the top of the band by early 2027, the RBA reckons. That’s going to make it harder for wages to keep up with prices, and it’s going to mean another year of families trying to keep up with the cost of living. Expect somewhat more muted brags coming out of the Albanese government. It raises the spectre that Canberra will feel compelled to extend power price relief beyond the end of this year, which will help households but further muddy the waters when it comes to inflation. As it turns out, even lukewarm growth might be too hot in an economy with no productivity growth. On the upside, the RBA doesn’t expect unemployment to pick up from here, confidently predicting the key jobless measure pretty steady at about 4.4%. Bullock made it clear that the board is aiming for 2.5% inflation, and that “just below three is not good”. As part of its latest forecasting, the RBA assumes the market’s prediction for one more rate cut in 2026. But the governor flagged that we shouldn’t be placing too much store in that. “It’s really an interesting question about whether there’s many more rate cuts left to come,” she said. That’s pretty cryptic, but it’s a long way from earlier this year when she was flagging multiple more rate cuts were in the offing."

I assumed that there was some sort of baseline, some inescapable bedrock knowledge of how to do it that now prevents any entry into the art form from falling below a certain standard. But I was wrong. The new series from Ryan Murphy, All’s Fair – starring Kim Kardashian , Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash as the founders of an all-female law firm delivering divorce-y justice to incredibly rich but slightly unlucky women under the azure skies of California – is terrible. Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible. While I try to get my thoughts in order after bearing witness to the first episode, I’m going to give you a few direct quotes, so you can see why I’m struggling. “My flight was turbulent and so is my mood,” says Liberty (Watts) to a man barring her way to a client. “He’s wolf-like in his possessiveness,” says a client of her husband. It’s so awful, it feels almost contemptuous. I looked for Julian Fellowes’ name in the credits, but apparently this is all the responsibility of Murphy and his co-creators, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken. They are also executive producers , along with Kim K, her mother Kris Jenner, Watts, Glenn Close (who also has a small role as the protagonists’ early mentor – I cannot imagine what kompromat the Kardashian clan have on her that led to her participation in this dreadful business), Nash and many, many more. The list goes on for ages. I suspect a variation of the bystander effect (whereby the more witnesses there are to a mugging – for example – the less likely any one is to intervene) is in operation. Thus, the more exec producers linked to it, the worse the show. Still, there’s worse and then there’s All’s Fair. Beyond the embarrassment of the script, there is the embarrassment of the performances; although I take the point that when someone – in this case, Murphy stalwart Sarah Paulson as psychopathic rival “lady” lawyer Carrington – is required to scream “Are you calling me an ugly duckling? So what if I give myself home perms? It’s economical!”, while smashing up her mentor’s office, they are probably not going to be able to give their best. Kim K as Allura, married to a football star who is resentful of the shadow cast over his own success by hers, is as expressionless as you might expect, but is at least inoffensively useless. Watts preens and pouts and poses in search of a character, and reminds you of nothing so much as Ally McBeal at her very worst , delivering her lines so archly that you can almost hear her joints cracking. The guest stars are worse. Nash – an unstoppable onscreen force – fares better in a role where the comic intent suits her well. But how parts for Black women are still being written as nothing more than Loud! And Sassy! I do not know. The one good thing And Just Like That … ever did was seem to be the nail in that coffin. But All’s Fair makes it look like Heimat. If this was all part of a lurid, camp drama played with gusto by all and narratively stuffed with treats, Murphy might have got away with it. But no one seems to know what they’re doing; the performances seem to respond to about nine different ideas of what the show is and the plots are dismal. The trio (“You’re the best divorce lawyers in town – maybe the country”) wrap up multiple cases in the time it takes Kim K’s nail varnish to dry. There’s the younger wife who falls in love with the woman her husband hires for a threesome, then walks off 10 minutes later with a $210m settlement once Nash acquires video evidence of his extensive perversions. (“Sow teats” is all I’m prepared to say here. Do not let this tempt you into watching.) There’s the older wife caught cheating (“He wasn’t even attractive! He just looked at me the way you used to look at me!”) and about to be thrown out of the New York marital home by her billionaire husband (“The guy who, like, owns all of cosmetics”) until Liberty flies out on the private jet to tell her she can take the $40m worth of jewellery she owns with her. These are fitted in around a couple of the worst kissing scenes ever seen on screen, the collapse of Allura’s marriage, a jarringly unfashionable obsession with brand names (“Let’s get those Goyard travel cases and start stuffing!”) and conspicuous consumption (“Oh my God – didn’t this belong to Elizabeth Taylor?”). All this, and a concept of female empowerment (“I settled … Did I not love myself enough?”) that would have shamed the Spice Girls 30 years ago."
039d37eba01d9f2d,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/nov/04/strike-3-porn-copyright-lawsuits,Rise of the ‘porno-trolls’: how one porn platform made millions suing its viewers,"Tue, 04 Nov 2025 12:18:28 GMT","A company called Strike 3, owner of Vixen and Tushy, has clogged US courts with lawsuits, mostly against porn watchers who feel shamed into settling privately When 73-year-old Tom Brown*, a retired police officer from Seattle, received a letter from Comcast, he might have mistaken it for a broadband bill. Instead, it was a subpoena. He had been sued in federal court for illegally downloading 80 movies. Some of the titles sounded cryptic – Do Not Worry, We Are Only Friends – or banal, like International Relations Part 2. Others were less subtle: He Loved My Big Ass, He Loved My Big Butt, and My Big Booty Loves Anal. Brown, who had spent decades investigating sex crimes, claimed he had never watched any of them. His years “dealing with pimping”, he wrote in a court filing, left him “with no interest in pornography”. He had been married for 40 years, he did not need to download Hot Wife, another title in the list. But the subpoena did not seem like something he could laugh off. It said he could face damages of up to $150,000 per movie – as much as $12m for all 80 films. If he did not respond promptly, the letter said, Comcast would identify him to the plaintiff in the case: a company called Strike 3 Holdings. Strike 3 is not a name that Brown, or most people outside the world of copyright law, would recognize. The Delaware-based corporation, formed in 2015, owns the intellectual property rights to a catalog of about 2,000 adult films, mostly made by Vixen Media Group, its porn production subsidiary. It had very little online footprint; no social presence to speak of. But its associates were better known. The company was co-founded by Greg Lansky, the French porn director whose recent pivot to the art world has yielded works such as Algorithmic Beauty , a marble reproduction of the Venus de Milo with breast implants taking a selfie. Lansky, a 42-year-old Parisian, was something of a celebrity in the adult industry, having formed Vixen, the production company behind some of the porn world’s most popular brands: Vixen, Slayed, Wifey, Milf-y, Tushy, Tushy Raw, Blacked, Blacked Raw. The studio’s commitment to high-production value had attracted dozens of awards in adult media and write-ups from outlets outside it. How One Pornographer Is Trying to Elevate Porn to Art, read a Forbes profile of Lansky from 2017. Lansky courted the press, branding himself as the “Steven Spielberg of porn”, and his company as a home for “feminist, ethical porn”. His free videos regularly ranked among the most-viewed scenes on PornHub, pushing viewers towards a paid tier. And his websites, Lansky has said, follow the “same business model as HBO”: premium subscription services, charging between $9.95 and $29.95 a month. What Lansky left out was that, since September 2017, Vixen’s owners had been pursuing another revenue stream: filing thousands of boilerplate copyright lawsuits against individual “John Does” and collecting millions in settlement fees – a mass litigation campaign one federal judge likened to “a hi-tech shakedown”. Brown, who was sued in November of 2017, numbered among Strike 3’s earliest targets. But in the eight years since, Strike 3 has become the most prolific copyright plaintiff in the country – filing, by the Guardian’s analysis of Pacer data, more than 20,000 federal copyright cases since September 2017. More recently, Strike 3 has been in the news for a higher profile case: a $350m copyright lawsuit against Facebook’s parent company Meta. Meta is a rare corporate defendant; the overwhelming majority of Strike 3’s suits are aimed at anonymous users across the country. Lansky, who sold his stake in Vixen Media in 2020, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did a representative for Vixen Media Group. A spokesperson for Strike 3 declined to answer specific questions about its legal strategy, but provided a statement to the Guardian: “Strike 3 is a legitimate film studio, that has created award-winning content, distributed through paid subscription platforms,” she wrote, “and has resorted to litigation only when necessary to protect the livelihood [sic] and its paying subscribers from widespread piracy.” Some judges are furious at just how many cases Strike 3 are filing. Armed with “hundreds of cut-and-pasted complaints and boilerplate discovery motions, Strike 3 floods this courthouse (and others around the country) with lawsuits smacking of extortion”, district judge Royce C Lamberth wrote. “It treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.” The sheer number of lawsuits has spawned a cottage industry of defense attorneys looking to take on the John Does’ cases. “I see new ones popping up all the time,” said attorney Steve Vondran, who is something of an influencer in this community, having defended more than 500 Strike 3 cases. He answers questions on YouTube and LinkedIn like: “Am I going to lose my house?” or “Will I have to file for bankruptcy?” Thousands of lawsuits follow a similar formula: Strike 3 claims to use a proprietary software called VXN Scan to track IP addresses that have downloaded porn they own. The software cannot identify the user beyond a rough geographic location, so Strike 3 files suit against an anonymous John Doe, and subpoenas their internet service provider (ISP) to unmask the user. The ISP in turn alerts the subscriber – which is when most people find out they have been sued. These people are often keen to settle, being cheaper than litigation and the only way to ensure their anonymity. That was certainly the case for Ken Jones*, a 28-year-old mental health worker, who received his own subpoena earlier this year. (Jones was the only defendant out of the dozen the Guardian contacted who was willing to discuss his case on the record, and he agreed to do so only on the condition of anonymity and without specifics to his settlement agreement.) “I remember being terrified. I had no idea what to do,” he said. “My mind kept going to the worst case scenario: life savings gone because of a few downloads. It felt unreal. I was unable to eat or sleep for some time.” Though he maintained to the Guardian he had never seen any of their films, Jones decided to settle because “it was the quickest way to leave this in the past”, he said . The “shame and taboo” made “the decision to fight the allegations a bit more challenging”. As Strike 3 tells it, these lawsuits are merely a defense against piracy. Its films, the company claims, “are among the most pirated content in the world” (though they did not provide data to support that claim). Critics see Strike 3 differently – the country’s leading “copyright troll ”, or a rightsholder who treats litigation as a business model, rather than a means of protecting their work. Strike 3 does not disclose how much it makes from lawsuits, but several defense attorneys who spoke to the Guardian estimated that the company makes millions each year. Though copyright law allows for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per film, in reality, most defendants pay about $750 per title, according to Vondran. But for several dozen titles, that can quickly become settlements that range between $20,000 and $30,000. “They want usually, minimum, what I call ‘five-figure settlements’: $10,000 or more,” Vondran said. “It’s why I think they wait to get at least 24 movies before they sue you, because that takes them right into that zone.” Even if only half of their cases settle in a given year, Strike 3 could collect between $20m and $30m in fees. Copyright trolls, a category which many have argued includes Strike 3, have skirted much notice outside legal circles, in part because they are seen as a relic of a bygone era. The copyright troll emerged from the 2000s internet, when the proliferation of peer-to-peer sharing tools first gave the public unprecedented access to almost any copyrighted work – be it My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow (2006) or bootleg footage of the heavy metal Fuck Christ Tour ‘93 . Between 2003 and 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America responded by filing more than 35,000 lawsuits against music pirates. Their campaign focused more on deterrence rather than revenue, but they created a model others soon copied. By the new decade, the courts were inundated by a new kind of mass copyright litigation – what law professor and part-time trolling historian Matthew Sag called, the “BitTorrent era”, after the sharing protocol popularized by sites like the Pirate Bay. These suits were perfectly legal; any copyright owner is entitled to sue for infringement. But between 2011 and 2014, several entities emerged as what Aaron Moss, author of the Copyright Lately newsletter, calls “ frequent flyers” – plaintiffs who seemed more interested in a “sue and settle” approach, rather than earnestly deterring pirates. These repeat litigants tended to come from struggling industries such as newspaper and independent movies (Voltage Pictures, the production company behind The Hurt Locker and later, Dallas Buyers Club , is notoriously aggressive for pursuing lawsuits against individual John Does) . But the vast majority came from porn companies – so many that the subset earned its own name: “porno-trolling”. Porno-trolls had “discovered the nexus of antiquated copyright laws, paralyzing social stigma, and unaffordable defense costs”, Judge Otis Wright wrote in the opinion that coined the term. “They exploit this anomaly by accusing individuals of illegally downloading a single pornographic video. Then they offer to settle – for a sum calculated to be just below the cost of a bare-bones defense.” Most “reluctantly pay rather than have their names associated with illegally downloading porn”, he went on. “For these individuals, resistance is futile.” Porn was itself a struggling industry; the proliferation of free streaming sites cut into producers’ profits. But the early porno-trolls seemed to stretch the bounds of what copyright law allowed. The bulk of these cases were represented by a firm called Prenda Law, many of whose clients, it turned out, did not exist. The firm, prosecutors later alleged, had a habit of creating “sham” porn companies with fake executives and suing on their behalf. (One of the “officers” of their supposed clients was in fact, per the Los Angeles Times , “the unpaid caretaker of Steele’s cabin in rural Minnesota” who had been promoted to fake porn executive without his knowledge.) By 2016, partners at Prenda Law, John Steele and Paul Hansmeier, were arrested by federal authorities and charged on 18 counts of fraud, perjury, and money laundering. At times, the complaint alleged , Steele and Hansmeier went so far as to film low-budget porn themselves and upload it to torrent sites “in order to lure people to download the movies”. Steele was eventually sentenced to five years in federal prison; Hansmeier to 14 . Not every porno-troll went to such overtly illegal lengths. If Prenda Law invented the model, Malibu Media professionalized it. The most prolific of the porn plaintiffs, Malibu Media was the legal arm of softcore website X-Art, run by the pornographer couple Colette Pelissier and Brigham Field. The couple’s prolific caseload attracted national press and a profile in the New Yorker . (The headline read: The Biggest Filer of Copyright Lawsuits? This Erotica Website.) In 2014, the couple had filed a third of all US copyright litigation that year: 1,300 infringement cases. By the end of the Obama administration, however, it seemed that copyright trolling had peaked. BitTorrenting was on the wane, as streaming platforms took over popular entertainment. Many of the biggest players seemed to burn out: the Prenda partners went to jail, and Malibu imploded into infighting. (In late 2016, Malibu’s founders sued their own lawyer, Florida attorney Keith Lipscomb, for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty; the case was later dismissed). The era of copyright trolling appeared to be winding down. “Filesharing lawsuit numbers drop by more than half,” Ars Technica reported that year. Sag, the field’s most-cited scholar, moved on to other research. “My gut says that it has decreased in volume somewhat,” one IP attorney told me, “but that’s just my gut feeling.” But in reality, the field was merely changing shape. In 2017, a lawyer from the Lipscomb firm, which had led Malibu Media’s copyright campaign, found a new job as general counsel at Vixen Media Group. Strike 3 filed its first copyright claim three months later. These days, bulk copyright cases still account for the majority of federal copyright filings; the field of participants has merely become more concentrated. According to Westlaw and Pacer data from the past three years, Strike 3 accounted for 50% of the federal copyright docket all on its own. I first heard about Strike 3 in September, when some legal clerk friends mentioned that nearly every judge on their circuit was handling a stack of Strike 3 cases – which are now so consistent as to have become routine. One would be hard pressed to find a federal judge in America who has not encountered the porn company; in a 2022 article about intellectual property experience in the western district of Texas, for example, half of the justices explicitly cited Strike 3: Chief judge Orlando Garcia: “The chief judge’s docket features a hefty amount of trademark and copyright work, particularly from a litigious porn studio, Strike 3 Holdings.” Judge Fred Biery: “Judge Biery’s docket, like the chiefs, is full of copyright suits filed by Strike 3.: Judge Robert Pitman: “His docket is likewise filled with cases from Strike 3.” Judge Jason Pulliam: “Judge Pulliam … like several of his colleagues, has Strike 3 filing up a big portion of his intellectual property work.” Judge Xavier Rodriguez: “And like some of his peers, he has faced a series of copyright suits from Strike 3.” The vast majority of Strike 3’s cases are settled or voluntarily dismissed for undisclosed reasons. None of the lawyers I spoke to could name a single claim that had gone to trial, and according to Westlaw’s litigation analytics, no case ever has. Only 10 or so people have even tried – one of them was Brown, the retired cop. Shortly after receiving his subpoena, he countersued the company for negligent emotional distress. He hired the intellectual property lawyer J Curtis Edmondson, a recurring figure on the Strike 3 circuit. Of the maybe 10 cases that “have gone the distance”, as he puts it, to litigate Strike 3’s allegations, Edmondson has represented all but one. Edmondson’s interest in litigating Strike 3 cases stems from the fact that, despite the company’s broad success in bringing copyright infringement claims, there remain several open questions about its methods. For one, IP addresses are notoriously fickle; it is easy to spoof an IP address through a virtual private network (VPN) or to use someone else’s address via malware that bypasses passwords. More to the point, as Mitch Stoltz, IP litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, puts it: “In a lot of cases, many, many people are using the same IP address.” Any given address may be shared between roommates, colleagues or members of a family. The prevalence of shared IP addresses has yielded some high-profile misfires; in 2011, for example, a porn company called Hard Productions sued a grandma in her 70s for torrenting hours of hardcore. (The retired widow “doesn’t know what BitTorrent is”, SF Gate reported at the time , though she did live next to “a handful of young men”.) A few years later, the production company behind the 2014 Adam Sandler film The Cobbler sued an Oregon man for allegedly downloading the film multiple times. The defendant, it turned out, ran an adult foster care, and his internet was regularly accessed by his residents. The case, Cobbler Nevada v Gonzales, went up to the ninth circuit, which ruled that IP addresses alone were insufficient for identifying infringement. In order to state a claim, the justices wrote, the plaintiff had to allege “something more” – some additional evidence to establish “a reasonable inference that a subscriber is also an infringer”. Brown found himself in a similar situation. As it turned out, the retired cop had an adult son who lived at home, who had not held a job in 10 years and lived with a social anxiety so absolute it prevented him from “talking to strangers” or driving, during which he would “constantly worry about how other people on the road can run into me”. As a result, the son later wrote in a legal filing: “I rarely leave my house and spend most of the time in my own room.” As the case progressed, Strike 3 found their “something more” – namely, the son’s profile on a uTorrent forum, where he wrote things such as “utorrent is a keeper.” But in this case, that was neither here nor there; they had sued Brown, not his son. Strike 3 quickly dropped the claims, and in 2020, a judge sided with Brown on his countersuit, affirming that he had not infringed any copyright and awarding him $47,777.26 in attorney’s fees. It remains the biggest victory any John Doe has notched against Strike 3, and yet for many critics, somewhat bittersweet. For Edmondson, the real question at the heart of Strike 3’s cases, and others like it, concerns the detection software used to identify those downloading Vixen’s porn videos. As part of a case, Strike 3 and its peers submit records that a given IP address is linked to specific downloads. But the software that produces those records is shrouded in mystery. “The corporate entities, people, software, and processes relied upon to prove infringement,” Sag wrote, “are somewhat shadowy and opaque.” And there are many reasons, Edmonson argues, to doubt their accuracy. When geolocation services cannot match an IP address with a specific location, as Vondran has noted, they may “randomly assign addresses to a general location”. In one prominent example from 2017, for example, Venice PI, the company that owns the copyrights to the Bruce Willis film Once Upon A Time in Venice, filed two suits against the same defendant: a 91-year-old man named Wilbur Miller who was not only deceased but had, as his widow attested, “suffered from dementia” for at least five years, rendering him “both mentally and physically incapable of operating a computer”. For a time, nearly every John Doe copyright case in the US claimed to use a suite of detection services based in Germany. These companies went by many names – Guardaley, IPP International, Maverickeye UG, Excipio Gmbh or Crystal Bay Corp – but they employed many of the same staff, filed many near-identical declarations in court cases, and seemed on the whole to be, per Sag, “essentially the same entity”. At the very least, they seemed to all be controlled by the same few people, though who those people were exactly was somewhat unclear. Crystal Bay Corp, for example, filed more than 500 declarations signed by an expert witness identified as “Darren M Griffin” – a man who, as Edmondson later wrote , “is in fact a completely fictitious person”. (Griffin did, however, have two flesh-and-blood colleagues at Crystal Bay, who variously attested to work at Guardalay, IPP and Maverickeye.) Strike 3 relied on these same services until 2018 , when they debuted their own tracking software, VXN Scan. In legal filings, Strike 3 claims it functions much like a BitTorrent client – downloading pieces of a given work from peers within the torrent network, and tracing those pieces back to the IP addresses seeding them. But Edmondson and others argue that the new detection tool, like its German predecessors, is a “black box”. As Edmondson put it: “Nobody knows how it works.” Because none of Strike 3’s cases have ever gone to trial, the company has never had to disclose the source code, or submit the software to closer scrutiny. In 2023, the Strike 3 legal community watched as one Florida defendant, a defense contractor and another Edmonson client, got closer than anyone ever had. After three years of litigation, a jury trial had been scheduled that spring. “We were all waiting to see – what was going to be the outcome?” Vondran recalled. “What was their technology going to show?” They never found out; on the eve of trial, the parties reached a confidential settlement. Strike 3’s critics may now get another chance. The company’s lawsuit against Meta, first filed in July, takes its copyright litigation to new heights, and a much larger target. The case emerged amid a flood of copyright lawsuits against the AI firms that now dominate the US economy. Meta and its peers have argued their use of copyrighted material is “transformative”, meaning it changes the original work enough to amount to fair use. But in a lawsuit filed by a group of authors, Meta emails revealed the company had torrented as much as 81.7 terabytes of pirated books and academic papers from such sites as Anna’s Archive. (A district judge later ruled against the authors on procedural grounds, without determining if Meta’s use of copyrighted work was lawful). The case prompted Strike 3 to examine its archive of recorded infringement, where it claims to have identified 47 different IP addresses owned by Meta. Strike 3 alleges that, over the course of years, Meta torrented at least 2,396 of its films for training artificial intelligence – infringements which could, if proven, amount to $350m in damages. The tech company is fighting the case – filing a motion to dismiss last week that argued Strike 3 had failed to show that Meta “was aware of the downloads” or “directed this activity”. The motion instead pointed the finger at Strike 3’s more common target: “unidentified users” who downloaded porn for “private personal use”. In a statement to the Guardian, Strike 3’s spokesperson contested that characterization: “This case is not about isolated personal activity,” she wrote. “This complaint reflects coordinated, corporate-scale conduct and the unauthorized distribution of creative works across multiple networks and jurisdictions.”) For Strike 3 defense lawyers, the larger case presents a new opportunity to scrutinize the porn firm’s piracy detection practices because, according to the complaint, the company tracked Meta’s downloads the same way they had the Does’: VXN Scan. If the case proceeds to trial, it may finally let the public look inside Strike 3’s black box. Strike 3’s spokesperson indicated they are keen to fight the case. “If the Meta case represents anything, it is Strike 3’s belief in its company and confidence in its technology,” she wrote. “Meta will undoubtedly bring the most powerful legal team to bear, but that does not change the facts or the law.” For Edmondson, the concern is the precedent it sets in a world where digital records are easy to falsify. “I kind of look 10 years into the future when it will be ridiculously easy to fabricate information,” he said. As he sees it, the courts should “take a stand now, at the beginning of a case, as to whether the evidence is good evidence or not”, because in the future, “you could just create that all using AI.”"

One supporter, Ibrahim Ahmed, 45, who has volunteered for the campaign, said that he was motivated to volunteer for Mamdani’s campaign because he believes that Mamdani “speaks the language that New York wants to hear right now.” “I’m feeling positive tonight” Ahmed, who has lived in New York City for 30 years, said. Another attendee, Shruti Ganguly, said that she has known Mamdani since he was 12 years old. “It’s electric, we feel hopeful” she said. Another Mamdani supporter, James Davis, whose labor union supported Mamdani, told the Guardian that he feels “hopeful” and “confident” tonight. “We’ve been out on the streets, we ve been knocking on doors, talking to our neighbors,” he said. Democratic representative Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor’s race, according to the Associated Press. Sherrill’s victory over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker ensures the state’s highest office will remain in Democratic hands after Trump helped his party make significant inroads in the state. The energy for Mikie Sherrill is high after Abigail Spanberger was declared the victor in the Virginia governor’s race. “It won’t be long now,” Senator Cory Booker joyfully proclaimed to the crowd in the East Brunswick Hilton ballroom as results poured in. “New Jersey has come together and tonight the whole nation will hear us roar.” Mikie Sherrill’s campaign vice-chair Patricia Campos-Medina declared that “We are the firewall against Donald Trump,” praising the New Jersey’s diverse immigrant communities that turned out for the Democratic Party. Attacks against New Jersey by the Trump administration are top of mind for speakers – on Snap, on healthcare, and on the Gateway Tunnel project. Upon display of CNN’s coverage of the first results for the mayoral election in New York City, the crowd did not cheer. NBC News projects that Ghazala Hashmi has prevailed in the state’s lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first Muslim American woman elected to statewide office in the US. Hashmi, a Democrat, flipped the seat currently held by Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, who lost her bid for the governorship to Abigail Spanberger.

Right now, there are hundreds of members of the press gathered at the Brooklyn Paramount theatre in Brooklyn. Twitch streamer Hasan Piker has arrived and is speaking with members of the press. Saam Niami reporting from Little Bangladesh in Queens: In Jackson Heights, one of New York’s most diverse neighborhoods, locals bought from vendors and headed home from the polls on Tuesday evening. Erbab Hussein, 58, a retiree from Astoria, said of Mamdani: “I don’t know what’s in his mind – I know he likes biryani. But when you put him up against Cuomo and Sliwa, I think Mamdani is the best. This is a city of change and I think his ideas are a little better off for a city that needs change.” Hussein also referenced the sexual harassment allegations against Andrew Cuomo , which Cuomo has denied. “I think he’s learned his lesson: you can’t compromise on family values here in New York,” Hussein said. “And Trump is trying to say [Mamdani] is a communist – come on! He’s a socialist, not a communist.” His friend Zubair, a 58-year-old fire safety director from Queens, chimed in: “He’s a very positive person. I think he’ll be our next mayor and I hope he has a very positive impact on the city.” at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in midtown Manhattan There’s a couple of hundred Cuomo supporters at his watch party now. I just saw a man down a bottle of Stella Artois. No sign of Cuomo yet. Among the attenders is Suzanne Miller, a realtor who volunteered for the Cuomo campaign. She said she is “50-50” about his chances of winning. Miller said she was nervous because of Zohran Mamdani’s energetic closing few days of the campaign. “There’s not a lot of substance, but there’s a lot of energy,” Miller said of the frontrunner. By contrast, Cuomo appealed because of “his passion, and his experience about running government, and how he’s going to really care and make New York great again”. Miller, who told me several times that she has a podcast , said Cuomo “understands politics”. “He understands how the left and right works, and he’s really the only Democrat running. He’s a true Democrat. He knows how it works. He’s a true politician, and he understands both sides, and that’s why he’s running on an independent line, where he’s going to hopefully get the support from both sides,” Miller said. Cuomo is running on an independent line because he lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June. at Abigail Spanberger’s victory party in Richmond, Virginia Abigail Spanberger has taken the stage, speaking from a podium where stagehands just posted a sign reading “governor-elect Spanberger”. Spanberger avoided mentioning Donald Trump on the campaign trail, but began her victory speech with what seems to be a nod to how her election will be interpreted in the context of his first 11 months in office. “Tonight, we sent a message. We sent a message to every corner of the Commonwealth, a message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country,” she said. “We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our commonwealth over chaos.” “Chaos” is doing a lot of work there, but it’s worth keeping in mind that the state is home to many Washington DC suburbs - which are full of federal workers whose jobs have been transformed since Trump came to office, if they’ve been able to keep them at all. All that being said, Spanberger has taken pains to strike a conciliatory tone to the 40% or so of Virginia voters who did not back her. “Those who were supporting my opponent are disappointed today. And to those Virginians who did not vote for me, I want you to know that my goal and my intent is to serve all Virginians,” she said. The cheers were particularly loud at Abigail Spanberger’s watch party when MSNBC noted that she was outperforming Kamala Harris in Virginia’s Loudoun county. A year ago, Harris’s underperformance in the Democratic-trending county on Washington DC’s far outskirts was the first sign that she was not going to be the next president. But for Spanberger’s campaign for governor, it’s clearly a different story. In New York , Yemeni cafes and beer gardens across Astoria, a neighborhood in Queens, are at capacity as New Yorkers await the results of Tuesday’s mayoral election. Long lines formed outside Ayat, a Palestinian bistro that just opened a location in Astoria, that was holding a free community dinner in honor of Mamdani. The Associated Press projects Democrat Abigail Spanberger has won the Virginia governor’s race, defeating Republican Winsome Earle-Sears . It’s a lightning-fast call in the closely watched race as polls closed just over an hour ago. All 100 of the seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates are also up for grabs tonight. Democrats currently hold a 51-48 majority in the chamber. Virginians cast more than 1.1m early in-person votes and nearly 330,000 mail-in ballots before election day, according to AP tallies. Voters in several US states cast ballots for redistricting in California , the mayor of New York and other elected offices. Take a look at US election day in pictures: Voters in several states went to the polls on Tuesday for elections that will provide a crucial window into nationwide support for Donald Trump ’s Republican allies, and potentially signal new momentum for the beleaguered Democratic party. Outside New York City , voters in deep-blue California could tear up their congressional maps in favor of a Democratic gerrymander meant to counter gains the GOP is expected to make elsewhere. And Virginia and New Jersey held high-stakes gubernatorial and legislative elections that may serve as a proxy for voters’ views on the president. Here’s a look at all the elections of the day: Here are clips of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo casting their votes in New York City ’s mayoral election. New York City’s voters are deciding the outcome of a generational and ideological divide that will resonate across the country as they choose the next mayor to run the nation’s largest city. Polls in New York City close at 9pm ET. The first results will come in shortly after and will continue to come in throughout the night. In 2021, most of the votes were counted before midnight, and the Associated Press declared Eric Adams the winner around midnight. Ever since his victory in the Democratic primary, Zohran Mamdani has been the clear favorite to win. Polls aggregated by the New York Times have Mamdani anywhere from five to 25 points ahead of his opponents, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, and Andrew Cuomo, who entered the race as an independent after losing in the Democratic primary. We will cover all the latest results and reactions from New York City and elections across the country here – and you can follow NYC results as they come in in our live results tracker: Welcome to our live coverage of election day evening across the US. Polls will soon close in the closely watched New York mayoral race, where Zohran Mamdani , the self-described democratic socialist, faces off against former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. If you’re just joining us now, here’s a recap of key moments today so far: In New York City, frontrunner and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo who is running as an independent, and Republican outlier Curtis Sliwa all cast their ballots earlier today. Polls close at 9pm ET, but more people have already voted in this election than in the entire 2021 mayor’s race, according to city election data. The first results will come in shortly after the polls close, and will continue to come in throughout the night. We’ll bring you the latest from our reporters on the ground. In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger has won the Virginia governor’s race, defeating Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, AP projects. All 100 of the seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates are also up for grabs tonight. Democrats currently hold a 51-48 majority in the chamber. Virginians cast more than 1.1m early in-person votes and nearly 330,000 mail-in ballots before election day, according to AP tallies. Earlier, Mamdani said he “will not be intimidated” by Donald Trump, as the president urged New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo. When asked about Trump’s comments on Truth Social that he plans to limit federal funds to the city if Mamdani wins, the Democratic nominee said he will “will treat his threats as they deserve to be treated, which are the words of a president and not necessarily the law of the land”. Earlier, Trump said that “any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer declined to reveal whom he voted for in the New York City mayoral race. At a news conference with other Democratic leaders at the Capitol in Washington DC, he was asked whether he had cast a ballot for Cuomo or Mamdani. Schumer, who voted early, told reporters: “Look, I voted and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City.” The outgoing New York City mayor, Eric Adams, cast his vote for Andrew Cuomo at an elementary school in Brooklyn, according to the New York Times. Speaking briefly to reporters outside, Adams said: “My vote is clearly for Governor Cuomo. We can’t go backwards. This city’s not a socialist city. The only message I can give to New Yorkers as I go to the next leg of my journey: I’m leaving you a good city. Don’t mess it up.”"

Zali Steggall , Sophie Scamps , Kate Chaney , Nicolette Boele , Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender confirmed they could not support the almost 1,500-page bill without major amendments to better protect nature. Chaney, the MP for Curtin, told reporters in Parliament House: My community really wants to see reform in this area. We need to do better at protecting nature and also making processes work faster for business. But when it comes to this package, the process sucks and the substance is questionable. Chaney and the fellow crossbenchers have drafted a raft of amendments, including to redesign the proposed “offsets” fund, prevent the minister from using a new “national interest” exemption to approve fossil fuel projects and insert climate as an object of the act. The bill includes a requirement for high polluting projects to disclose their emissions as part of the application process but does include not a “climate trigger” that could block their approval. Boele said the climate crisis was “turbocharging Australia’s extinction crisis”. How can we expect to help the glossy black cockatoos, our wonderful tall forests, or even our wonderful and diverse reefs, if we’re not dealing with the threats that they face? Scamps – who will move an amendment to remove an exemption for native forest logging – said the laws were riddled with “enormous loopholes”. We’ve got one set of environment laws to protect our nature, and they have utterly failed us for the last 25 years, we now have 19 ecosystems on the brink of collapse, but the changes that the government has proposed do not guarantee that our nature will be better protected. ‘Unedifying’, ‘unnecessary distraction’ says Hume on abortion remarks Earlier on Sky News today Jane Hume also weighed in on the four Liberal MPs who tied legislation to protect paid leave for the parents of a stillborn baby to late-term abortions. Hume said she respects other views but, “let’s not use important legislation as a vehicle for personal crusades.” I think that there was a bit of horror from many of the women in our party ... this is a very serious and deeply personal issue. I thought it was an unnecessary distraction and perhaps a bit of an error of judgment. I respect their views, they’re not my views, and I don’t think it was a particularly edifying moment for us. Hume wouldn’t be drawn on whether the comments would impact Hastie’s leadership ambitions. The government has passed its bill to establish a centre for disease control through the Senate with amendments from the Greens. The Greens secured an amendment to ensure the annual report includes the impact of the climate crisis on Australians’ health and an update preparedness for future pandemics. The CDC’s advisory committee will also include a First Nations person and disabled person with health expertise. The CDC was a post-pandemic election promise by Labor, which will now go back to the house for a final tick. Data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) today reveals that that total government expenditure on public health has fallen. Total expenditure on public health activities was estimated to be $5.4bn in 2023–24, or about $200 per person. In real terms, this represented a 29.5% or $2.3bn decrease from 2022–23. Between 2013-14 and 2018-19, government spending on public health grew at an average annual rate of 2.5%. This was followed by an increase of 25.8% in 2019-20, before accelerating significantly during the early pandemic. Since 2022-23, however, public health spending has been on a downward trend. Public health focuses on prevention, promotion and protection rather than on treatment. Only about 2% of health funding in Australia goes to prevention. Economic and health experts said the government must to dramatically increase public health spending on prevention, in a peer-reviewed commentary published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health. This would boost the economy, reduce healthcare and treatment costs and improve Australians’ wellbeing, the paper said. Nearly 60% of Australians live with chronic disease, one-third of which is preventable. Lead author of the paper, Associate Prof Jaithri Ananthapavan said: As well as direct healthcare costs, these diseases cost the economy because people with chronic illness have more days off from work, have reduced productivity while at work and also leave the workforce prematurely. ‘I’ve never heard of a woman doing that’: McIntosh downplays colleagues’ concerns linking stillbirth leave to late-term abortions Shadow minister Melissa McIntosh has downplayed concerns raised by conservative Coalition colleagues about the potential for women to seek late-term abortions in order to access paid parental leave, saying “I’ve never heard of a woman doing that”. McIntosh, the shadow minister for women, was asked about comments from Andrew Hastie , Barnaby Joyce and others during the debate on Priya’s Law, which would guarantee paid parental leave for mothers who lose their baby. Numerous conservative Coalition MPs and senators had raised concerns about the law’s interaction with abortions, with Tony Pasin saying he was concerned the bill would “treat an intentionally late-term aborted child in the same way as it would a natural stillbirth or a baby who dies shortly after birth”. Earlier today, opposition leader Sussan Ley called commentary linking stillborn bill to late-term abortions “insensitive”; Jane Hume called it “unedifying”, adding “I think that there was a bit of horror from many of the women in our party”. McIntosh defended the right of MPs to raise concerns about conscience issues, though welcomed the passage of Priya’s Law. I think about the families, and we’ve all got friends and families who’ve lost children so late, and I can imagine how much it stirs emotional turmoil in people. So that was their decision. And I hope we can move on from that. And I hope that bill that did go through does help some of those Australian families that are going through so much. Pressed on the issue raised by Hastie, Joyce and others, McIntosh added: “I’ve never heard of a woman doing that. I don’t know, you as reporters, have you ever come across a story where a woman has done that?” I know that Andrew Hastie is a man of faith, so that’s their position, but that bill did go through, and I hope it does bring some comfort to families that would be very traumatised. Liberal senator says ‘no challenge on’ against Sussan Ley as net zero emissions debate continues Jonno Duniam has backed his leader as the public and private debate over the Liberal party’s energy policy and future leadership prospects continue. Speaking to Sky News, the conservative senator says it’s been a “difficult time” for the party. There is no challenge on, and Sussan Ley has, I think, led this debate very well … Sussan has been very constructive and conciliatory about this, and managed to enable us to have our say in a robust way. On the net zero issue, Duniam says there will be an “element” of the National’s policy to tie emissions reduction in Australia to OECD nations. Asked about whether the party should keep a commitment to net zero by the end of the century, Duniam says: I think that what has happened in this debate is there’s been a lot of wrapping ourselves up in or tying ourselves up in knots about a particular element of this. They talk about doing what our neighbours do, or at least the OECD equivalents do, in terms of emissions reductions. There will be an element of that in our policy, how it’s framed up. I’ll allow Dan Tehan , when this process is concluded, along with Sussan Ley, to speak about [it]. Greens to lead Senate inquiry into capital gains tax discount The Greens will lead a Senate select committee inquiry into the capital gains tax discount, after a successful motion by senator Nick McKim on Tuesday. The investor tax break, introduced in 1999, delivers a 50% tax discount on the capital gains made from selling an asset which had been held for longer than 12 months. The CGT, in conjunction with negative gearing rules, has been blamed for fuelling rampant speculation on housing which has contributed to soaring home prices and today’s affordability crisis. Like a similar inquiry into the stage 3 tax cuts before they were remodelled, the Greens inquiry will also highlight the inequity of tax rules that disproportionately benefits wealthier Australians. Parliamentary Budget Office analysis commissioned by the progressive party shows that 65% of the forgone revenue from the CGT discount in 2024-25 went to the top 5% of earners. In comparison, 36% of the benefits from the original stage 3 tax cuts – which were judged to be too favourable to the rich – would have gone to the top 5% of earners. The committee is due to report back on 17 March. The teal independents will oppose Labor’s rewrite of environment protection laws when the bill is put to a vote in the lower house in coming days. Zali Steggall , Sophie Scamps , Kate Chaney , Nicolette Boele , Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender confirmed they could not support the almost 1,500-page bill without major amendments to better protect nature.

Sydney peace prize ‘disappointed’ Wong declined meeting with laureate The Sydney peace prize has said it’s “disappointed” foreign minister Penny Wong would not meet with former UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay , the prize laureate who addressed the National Press Club on Tuesday. Pillay was the first non-white judge in South Africa’s high court, served as a judge of the international criminal court, and is a former chair of the UN’s Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Territory of Palestine and Israel. Director of the Sydney peace prize, Melanie Morrison , told Guardian Australia they had reached out to Wong’s office in August to arrange a meeting. They said that after several follow ups, Wong’s office said the minister was unavailable. Morrison said: As a matter of course, given the calibre of this years’ laureate, it’s disappointing the meeting was declined by the foreign minister’s office. Instead, Pillay met with the assistant foreign minister, Matt Thistlethwaite , the government confirmed, with an adviser from Wong’s office present. Morrison said Pillay also had a meeting with the department of foreign affairs and the ambassador for gender equality on Monday. Opposition accuses Labor of ‘rushing’ nature legislation Liberal MP Julian Leeser is now responding to the prime minister on the nature laws. He said: This bill doesn’t make small changes or amendments. It’s almost 1,500 pages of legislation and explanatory materials that reaches into every corner of the economy that builds, digs, grows and manufactures. He accused the government of rushing the bill, saying “the Senate has already had to step in and refer it to an inquiry”. He continued: This matters because rushing this legislation will have real consequences for Australians. Minister Plibersek attempted to make these reforms in the last parliament, they were withdrawn under internal pressure. Labor promised an Environment Protection Agency at two elections, and four years on, it hasn’t delivered what it promised. Staying with Albanese for a moment, who is speaking now about the nature laws in the lower house. This bill is about driving better, clearer and speedier decision making, making it easier to get an answer from government sooner, a quicker yes or a quicker no. Providing that certainty is the key to encourage investment in our economy. And every bit as important as encouraging investment in our economy is ensuring there’s a better system of protections for Australia’s precious and unique natural environment. They can talk about the problem, or they can vote for the solution. That is the choice that will be before the senate. I say this to the opposition and to the Greens political party. This is good for jobs, good for industry, but it’s also good for the environment. Anthony Albanese is speaking in the lower house now about the proposed nature laws. Australia doesn’t have to choose between a strong economy or a healthy environment. We don’t have to choose between creating jobs and cutting emissions. We can do both. Indeed, we must do both, because each one depends on the other. The current laws are broken. They were written by the Howard government for a very different Australia, and they haven’t just become obsolete. They’ve become an obstacle. They’re not working for the environment and they’re not delivering for business. They are a barrier to jobs and investment across our nation, and in many cases, they overlap or duplicate state and local government processes. Here’s a video of federal communications minister, Anika Wells , talking about the under-16s social media ban a short time ago. Could Roblox be added to the social media ban for under 16s? Jumping back to that press conference with Anika Wells and eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant , while Roblox has not yet been added to the list of banned platforms, Inman Grant said it’s “on the line”. As we brought to you earlier, the eSafety commissioner said the list of platforms is “dynamic” while Wells said this morning the legislation isn’t “set and forget”. Inman Grant also brought up a few elements of the Roblox platform that are of concern to her. [The list] will always change and we’ve told companies, so for instance Roblox, as was just mentioned, some of these companies when we did the assessment were very much, what I would say, on the line. So we had to put our minds to what is the sole and significant purpose – online gaming, right? But there’s chat functionality in the US, they’ve launched a program called Moments, which is very much like stories, which is online social interaction. We will be watching as well and if they start rolling out features that look more like they’re becoming a social media company than an online gaming company, then we will seek to capture them. WA, which has declared itself as having the strongest economy in the nation, also gets a phenomenally generous take of the GST carve-up between states and territories. Economists such as Saul Eslake have been advocating to change the Morrison-era deal that put a floor under WA’s GST take and will give the state an extra $60bn in tax revenue over the next decade . Roger Cook tells ABC RN Breakfast that while his state only represents 11% of the nation, it contributes 45% of the nation’s exports, and is the “biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP.” Prior to the actual deal that was done to preserve our 75% floor of the GST share, we saw Western Australia’s contribution to the other states reach almost 90%. That is, we just retained 11% of our GST. Now in WA we utilise that revenue to ensure that we can develop the economic infrastructure, create the sort of frameworks and the regulation for the industry which ultimately pays significant resources to the commonwealth and other states through company tax and other measures. Host Sally Sara pushes back, saying Eslake argues that private industry provides a lot of that infrastructure, but Cook says the state government provides the roads, water and port infrastructure. WA premier says Coalition ‘failing the big moral challenge of our time’ Western Australian premier Roger Cook is in town this week as the government tries to gain support for its environment protection reforms (that political followers will know the WA government was not a fan of last time around). It’s part of the reason why Murray Watt made WA his first visit as a newly sworn in environment minister to get the state on side. Cook spoke to ABC RN Breakfast a little earlier this morning and said he “commend[s]” Watt’s work. I believe we can do this. We have obviously met with environmental groups and with our big resource companies and other members of our industry in Western Australia all the time. They’re encouraged by the progress that’s been made. Obviously, there’s still elements of the legislation that they want to see addressed , but I think there’s a great sense of consensus and collaboration at the moment to see if we can find that space, which creates the balance, the balance between encouraging industry but also protecting the environment. Asked to weigh in on the other big issue of the week – net zero – Cook says the Coalition are “failing the big moral challenge of our time”, and would be “very concerned” if the Libs go down the same path as the Nats on scrapping net zero altogether. They’re quite frankly just starting to retreat to the extremes of the political spectrum. They need to come back to the centre … And I think we should all get round the joint and global consensus position of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. FoI bill returns to house for debate after government ‘sees the light’, says Coalition After the opposition kicked up a stink yesterday on the government’s attempt to move the controversial freedom of information bill to the smaller federation chamber, the government has brought back the debate to the house. The chief opposition whip, Aaron Violi , who yesterday tried to table a list of 16 opposition speakers who were going to miss out on being able to debate the bill in the house, is the first to speak today (his tabling request was rejected FYI). It’s nice that this bill has returned to the house today, the manager of business [ Tony Burke ] saw this light. Independent MP Zali Steggall , who has been a staunch critic of the bill, is also speaking on it. This bill was drafted without consultation, introduced without transparency, and designed in a way that rewards secrecy. At a time when public trust in government is already low, this legislation seeks to make it harder for Australians to access information and easier for government to hide it. This is not reform, this is regression."

The governor said he expects those numbers to grow. A UPS flight took off from the airport and crashed around 5.15pm local time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had three crew members on board, according to UPS. It was bound for Honolulu. Beshear said during a Tuesday evening press conference he believes there are at least three fatalities, but that number will grow as emergency crews parse through the debris, and 11 injuries. He added that the crash took place near two businesses: a recycling center, which took a direct hit, and an auto parts shop where all but two employees were accounted for. Their identities will be released soon, Beshear added. “Watching that video, I think we’re all very, very worried about them,” he said of the airplane crew members and missing employees. The National Transportation Safety Board will be leading the official investigation going forward, a UPS spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian. A huge plume of smoke was visible south of the airport shortly afterwards. The Louisville metro police department (LMPD) said multiple agencies were responding to reports of a crash. In a post on X, Beshear, described the situation as “serious” and said that he is heading to Louisville. “We have virtually every fire, police, emergency response group that is responding right now to what you’re seeing,” Beshear said during the press conference. “This is an active scene with fire and debris,” LMPD said in a statement. “Stay away.” Videos posted on social media appeared to show an active blaze. A shelter-in-place order was issued for all locations within 5 miles of the airport, which was closed. The order was later extended to “all areas north of the airport to the Ohio River”, covering much of the city. “Please remain away from the area until further notice,” added LMPD."

After winning the 2022 election, the Albanese government commissioned former Australian public service commissioner Lynelle Briggs to review appointment processes for government boards. Its terms of reference were limited to public sector board appointments. The report was not intended to consider current appointments or appointment processes related to individuals. Initiated in February 2023, the review’s final report was handed to the government in August 2023 but has never been made public. It had been expected to be published by late 2023. The finance and public service minister, Katy Gallagher, has said the report is still being considered by cabinet. But secrecy around Briggs’s findings has angered crossbenchers in parliament, including ACT senator David Pocock . Last week he moved a motion to change the Senate’s standing orders to add extra questions to question time until the report was made public, giving non-government senators more opportunity to scrutinise the government. That move, supported by the Coalition and the Greens, led to a marathon question time and retaliation by Labor, which lost a motion on Tuesday trying to force attendance with roll calls in the chamber. Gallagher told the Senate last week the Briggs report would be released “when that work is finished” and accused Pocock and other non-government senators of abusing Senate orders to seek unreasonable numbers of government documents. Figures cited by Labor suggest in the 1990s, the Keating government received 53 Senate orders to produce documents, compared with 336 during the most recent parliamentary term. On Wednesday, Gallagher offered a closed-door briefing on the report’s findings to the finance and public administration committee and said the report would be released before the end of the year, as required by a Senate order. The briefing would include “a verbal overview” of the findings and an opportunity for committee members to ask questions. “This briefing would allow me as the responsible minister to provide an update to the Senate and act as an interim step to meeting the order whilst the report remains before cabinet,” Gallagher said. The shadow home affairs minister, Liberal senator Jonathan Duniam, moved an amendment to reinstate the longer format for question time if the government does not provide the report by 31 December. “We want that document tabled and in order to ensure it is provided as the government has promised it would,” he said. Pocock sought to bring forward the deadline to 24 November, the Monday of the final parliamentary sitting week of the year, to stop the government “burying” the report in the pre-Christmas period. He slammed Liberal and National senators for voting with Labor on Wednesday. “The Coalition has handed Labor a get out of jail free card and undone the success of the Senate in holding the government of the day accountable for compliance with its orders. “Given the Senate’s rejection of the government’s claim of cabinet-in-confidence, this is a loss for transparency and a disservice to the will of the people who sent us to this place. “The silver lining is the added scrutiny it has brought to Australia’s political duopoly and the deals they do to try and preserve the status quo.” Senate question time ran for more than three hours last Thursday, leading to sometimes chaotic scenes. This week Labor accused some senators of routinely skipping question time, in order to go to the parliamentary gym or work in their offices. But Labor’s proposal to hold a roll call for attendance was soundly defeated. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said crossbench senators wanted to improve government processes and provide transparency. “There’s a reason why this report was commissioned in the first place. It’s because there is a problem, there is a view that jobs for mates is an issue within successive governments,” she said. Labor is also facing criticism over its plans to curb transparency through its freedom of information changes, an unpopular plan being debated in the lower house this week."
cc3d907c562cef3e,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/05/australia-ashes-squad-cricket-jake-weatherald-first-test-perth,Jake Weatherald in contention for Test debut after being named in Australia’s Ashes squad,"Wed, 05 Nov 2025 01:13:09 GMT","Opener included in 15-man squad for first Test in Perth Selectors will wait before making final decision on opening spot Opener Jake Weatherald has won a place in Australia’s Ashes squad and is the leading contender to partner Usman Khawaja at the top of the order for the first Test in Perth. But the Tasmania batter has not yet secured a spot in the XI for the series opener, with chief selector George Bailey saying he would wait until the end of the coming round of Sheffield Shield matches before making a decision on the final line-up. “I think if you look at [Weatherald’s] performance over 18, 24 months, it’s been really solid,” Bailey said. “There’s a method there that I think we like and is complimentary to those other players around him in the squad. He scores at a good rate, the way he goes about building his innings has been impressive.” Weatherald averages almost 38 in first class cricket, but has scored three half centuries in his three Sheffield Shield matches this season. Marnus Labuschagne has also been recalled after he was left out of the tour of the West Indies earlier this year, and Bailey confirmed the Queenslander had the “capability” of opening. The selector said Labuschagne has made some adjustments and is in a “good place”. The 31-year-old has scored five centuries already this season. “As soon as he was left out of that West Indies [tour] team, his first question is, ‘well how many runs do you need for me to come back?’,” Bailey said. “It was a very clear message that the runs would be a byproduct of some of the other things that we wanted to see, and part of that was – not getting back to the old Marn – but a method and a way of batting and some technical things that we wanted to see.” The decisions at the top of the order will be influenced by the fitness of Cameron Green, the all-rounder who can bat up and down the order. Bailey said he wanted to see 15 to 20 overs in the coming Shield match from the 26-year-old, who has battled side soreness this season. However, he didn’t rule out selecting Green as a specialist batter again, after he was deployed as a non-bowling No 3 as recently as July against the West Indies. “If someone’s an all-rounder, you want them to be able to, in an ideal world, be capable of performing their skills, so it’s a nice piece of the puzzle,” Bailey said. “But if it’s not the case, then it ends up being the another Test and that’s OK, we’ll work through it.” Beau Webster has deputised ably in the all-rounder role. He has averaged almost 35 with the bat and 23 with the ball since coming into the side for the New Year’s Test. Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett provide the squad’s bowling depth, and both have a chance of playing at some point during the series given captain Pat Cummins’s estimated return for the second Test is not yet confirmed.

Weatherald’s inclusion dashes hopes of recalls for Sam Konstas and Matt Renshaw. Bailey said he “feels for” Konstas, the 20-year-old opener who starred on debut at the MCG last year but has now dropped down the list of options. “At the moment if he farts, it’s a headline,” Bailey said. “There’s a handful of young guys his age playing Shield cricket around the country, and they’re all learning, and they’re all going through a journey of becoming the best cricketer they can be, and Sammy’s no different to that. He just happens to be doing it under what seems to be immense scrutiny at the moment.” Steve Smith will captain the side in Cummins’s absence, though the paceman will be with the squad in Perth as he continues his rehabilitation. The first Ashes Test begins on 21 November at Optus Stadium. Australia squad : Steve Smith (captain), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald and Beau Webster."

The threatened kārearea was crowned bird of the year in September, in the country’s long-running annual competition. It is New Zealand’s fastest bird, capable of flying 200km/h in its pursuit of prey, and has impressive talons. Kārearea are powerful aerial hunters and watch other birds, lizards or small mammals – sometimes larger than themselves – from a high vantage point before diving to snatch their prey. During nesting season, they become incredibly territorial and protective, which some walkers have discovered the hard way. “I heard them before I saw them, then they swooped down on me a few times and circled me from above,” said Ellie Morgan, a photographer who encountered kārearea in Hanmer Springs, in the South Island last month. “I got a few good shots of them in the sky but didn’t hang around long as I had clearly upset them and thought they must be protecting a nest,” she said in a post to facebook. Last week, the Hutt city council, north of Wellington, warned people to stay away from a bush track in the region, after nesting kārearea were spotted. “They have unfortunately been attacking track users on the path,” the council said. “We recommend avoiding this area for now and giving the 2025 bird of the year winners some space during the nesting season.” Wellingtonian Dianna Thomson told broadcaster RNZ she was on a bush walk with her son when they encountered a kārearea. “This kārearea swooped over my head, like really close,” she said, adding it gave her a new respect for the bird. “It was pretty cool really … It’s good to know our place in the world, isn’t it?” There are roughly 5,000 to 8,000 of the kārearea left, according to the Department of Conservation. They live in forests around the country and are vulnerable to predation by introduced mammals such as cats, hedgehogs and stoats who eat their ground-dwelling eggs. Kārearea breed from spring until summer and will defend their young until they are ready to leave the nest, said Ali Meade, the conservation delivery manager at Forest & Bird. The birds display territorial behaviour within a 400m radius of their nest, but going within 50m of the nest will get them “really, really excited”, she told the Guardian. “They dive-bomb you … normally at the top of the head,” Meade said, adding that they typically will avoid contact, in order to protect themselves. Habitat destruction has pushed the birds into smaller areas where there are likely to be walking tracks. “We’re possibly coming into contact with them a bit more,” Meade said. Walkers should avoid areas that display ‘kārearea nesting’ signs, and if they find themselves within swooping distance, they should calmly and quickly leave, she said."
